        <titulo>Dallas police HQ attack: Suspect James Boulware killed - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)A man unleashed a barrage of gunfire on Dallas' police headquarters and planted explosives outside the building early Saturday -- narrowly failing to wound anyone -- leading to a chase to a suburb that ended with SWAT officers killing him in his parked van at a restaurant parking lot. Police shot him through the windshield of the armored van about an hour before dawn after he made more threats, sometime after they chased him to the lot outside the Jack in the Box restaurant in the suburb of Hutchins, authorities said. But police didn't confirm his death until the early afternoon, with a bomb squad needing to inspect the vehicle after the suspect told them that the vehicle contained explosives. "We believe this suspect meant to kill officers," police Chief David Brown told reporters. "We barely survived the intentions of this suspect." Before he was shot, the suspect ranted to police by phone, identifying himself as James Boulware, and alleging police were responsible for his child having been taken from him, Brown said. Police have said that they couldn't confirm that the name was the suspect's real identity. Dallas-area resident Jim Boulware told CNN's Sara Sidner that police and agents from the FBI and ATF came to his house and told him that his son, James, had been killed after the standoff. Jim Boulware said he thought his son would have directed his anger not at police but at his mother, who was granted custody of James Boulware's son in April. Authorities wanted to search the house, Jim Boulware said, because his son visited the home a few hours before the shooting. The attack began shortly after midnight, with the man firing an assault weapon and then a shotgun from the outside, riddling police cars and the windows of the headquarters, which sits across the street from a large apartment and office complex. Dallas Deputy Police Chief Gilberto Garza said at times the suspect was on foot as he fired an automatic rifle. "He was always in or just outside his van," the deputy chief said. Officers, staffers and perhaps others narrowly avoided being shot. The chief said rounds hit not only an occupied squad car but also the police headquarters' front lobby, its information desk and the building's second floor. One lobby staffer had just risen from a desk to get a soda -- and bullet holes there suggest that the worker would have been shot otherwise, Brown said. Bullets might have been whizzing near residents across the street, too. Rick Birt, who lives in the South Side on Lamar complex, was taking a phone video of the gunfire from his open apartment window. "I heard snaps overhead, so I could tell that was rounds coming in our direction," Birt, a former Marine, told CNN. Parts of the initial attack were caught on video by several people nearby, and the police chief said he believed the sounds indicated some of the gunfire came close to those making the recordings. But based on the suspect's calls to police, "we think he was specifically targeting police officers," Brown said. The attacker also planted at least one set of pipe bombs in a bag outside, designed to "explode upon touch," Brown said. Police returned fire and gave chase. Video recorded by a witness and aired on CNN shows the dark van ramming the nose of a police car before retreating in reverse.  After the shootout at police headquarters, the suspect called 911 and gave a four- to five-minute rant, accusing of police of being to blame for him losing custody of a child, Brown said. Police later found his number and called him back, eventually allowing SWAT officers to negotiate. Officers pursued the van to the restaurant parking lot in Hutchins -- roughly 13 miles southeast of the Dallas police headquarters -- and the man opened a van door and again shot at police, injuring no one, Brown said. After a gunfire exchange, police called the man for negotiations. Shortly after 4:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET), police used a .50-caliber rifle to hit the engine block, disabling the van, Brown said, because the man on the phone had been increasingly hostile and agitated. Police didn't want him to drive away and threaten anyone else, Brown said. About a half hour later, SWAT snipers shot the man through the van's front windshield, Brown said. The man had become increasingly angry and made threats before cutting off the negotiations, the chief said. The suspect claimed that the van contained C-4 plastic explosives, according to Brown. "They (SWAT officers) made the call, and I believe it's the right call ... to stop his violence," Brown said. Authorities found at least two more pipe bombs in the van, police said. Video from CNN affiliate KTVT showed an explosion near the van, after police said they would use "an explosive water charge" to neutralize any explosives inside. Early Saturday afternoon, KTVT footage showed the van was on fire. "During intentional detonation of susp(ect) ordnance, susp(ect) van caught fire and rounds are going off inside," Dallas police tweeted.  Back outside headquarters, police found at least one package of pipe bombs. It was set to detonate upon touch, Brown said. "(An officer), during the searching, almost tripped over it. If he had touched it, he wouldn't have survived," Brown said. The package exploded when a bomb-squad robot tried to move it Saturday morning, police said. Dallas police posted a tweet showing that vehicles were damaged in the blast.  The crackling sound of the Dallas shootout got the attention of Birt, the ex-Marine who lives across the street from the police headquarters with his wife. "We heard loud noises, my wife asked if I thought they were shots," he said. "I went over to the window and put one of them up. And we heard more shots being fired, and I turned to my wife and said, 'Yeah, that's definitely gunfire.'" He got his cell phone and recorded video. After the van fled, police informed him and his wife that they and others to evacuate the building. Dallas police said the complex's residents might have to stay away for hours, since officers needed to determine whether more bombs were planted in the area. As for the suspect, investigators have no reason to believe the man had "any nexus to terrorism," Brown said. Investigators are looking into whether a van sold in Newnan, Georgia, on eBay last week may be the van used in the Dallas attack, a source familiar with the investigation said. They are investigating, among other things, who may have purchased the vehicle. Jim Boulware said his son took a bus last week to Georgia and bought a van. Witnesses initially indicated up to four people attacked the Dallas police building. But Brown said investigators concluded that only one person was involved and that witnesses were describing the same person at different times and locations.

        <titulo>Joyce Mitchell: New York prison worker charged  - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-13T18:19:17Z</data>
        <autor>Faith Karimi, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Prison worker Joyce Mitchell is in custody, accused of aiding in a daring prison escape. The two convicted killers she allegedly helped are free, but on the run. Mitchell allegedly provided Richard Matt and David Sweat with the tools to cut through cell walls for their escape from an upstate New York prison a week ago. "The defendant did intentionally ... and unlawfully introduce hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver bit, dangerous contraband, into Clinton Correctional Facility," court records said. Mitchell allegedly brought the items to the prison on May 1. On Saturday, Mitchell was transferred from the Clinton County Jail about 150 miles south to the Rensselaer County Correctional Facility. Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said the move was meant to avoid the distraction of jailing her near the massive manhunt. Her next court appearance is Monday. She was arraigned Friday night on a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. She pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she faces up to eight years behind bars.  Matt and Sweat's escape was discovered during an early morning bed check at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. While making their escape, they slipped through holes and cut into a steel plate and a steam pipe, then got out through a manhole and onto the street. And Mitchell had a lot to do with their ability to plan out the daring escape, authorities said. She supplied tools used in the escape and was their possible getaway driver before she got cold feet, authorities said. Her cell phone was also used to make calls to people connected to Matt, according to a source. It's not known who made these calls. Mitchell has told investigators that Matt made her feel "special" though she didn't say she was in love with him, a source familiar with the investigation said. Her husband and prison co-worker, Lyle Mitchell, is also under investigation, but has not been arrested or charged, authorities said. He worked in the maintenance department at the tailoring block where his spouse was employed, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said. Lyle Mitchell has worked at the prison since 2005, most recently as an industrial training supervisor, the same title his wife held, according to state records. Lyle Mitchell cried when allegations surfaced against his wife, according to a friend who did not want to be named. The friend said Lyle Mitchell asked how his wife could do such a thing. Infamous manhunts: When police have tracked fugitives into the wild  Joyce Mitchell provided hacksaw blades, drill bits and lighted eyeglasses to the convicts before their escape, sources said. The hacksaw blades and other items given to Matt were purchased over the past few months, according to law enforcement sources. Matt and Sweat used power tools to cut through cell walls. Despite the time, effort and noise likely involved, authorities didn't learn anything was amiss until a bed check at 5:30 a.m. Saturday. Authorities believe the fugitives are continuing their escape as a pair, two law enforcement sources said. Towns under virtual lockdown  State Department of Corrections officials had received a complaint about the relationship between Joyce Mitchell and one of the two escapees, according to a state official. The department didn't find enough evidence to support the complaint, though that does not mean the inmate and prison worker weren't close. "I don't believe that the information was that there was absolutely no relationship," said Wylie, the district attorney.  More than 800 state, local and federal law enforcement officers are searching for the escapees, New York State Police said. They have been following more than 700 leads developed in the weeklong manhunt. Tracking dogs picked up the scent of both prisoners at a gas station and followed it east toward the town of Cadyville, Wylie said. The gas station has a Subway sandwich shop, and the two might have been rummaging for food in the trash bin, authorities said. "It could have been something that occurred earlier in the week," the district attorney said Friday of when the scent was left. "But we're hoping that it was two nights ago, and they're closing in on the two men right now." As the woman who allegedly helped them escape sits in jail on bail, the search for the convicts has been going on since June 6. According to state police, Sweat was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole in the murder of a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002, and Matt was sentenced to 25 years to life in the kidnapping and murder of a man in 1997.

        <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)Seven new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS virus, have been confirmed in South Korea, the country's Ministry of Health said Sunday. Fourteen people died from the virus, 10 have recovered after being infected and 121 are under treatment, the ministry said. Health officials this weekend said the outbreak was slowing, but additional cases were expected. Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. The 68-year-old patient, who had just returned from four Middle Eastern countries, went from facility to facility before getting properly diagnosed. He would become "patient zero" of the country's outbreak. The outbreak has sparked international concern, shuttered more than 3,000 schools and stalled the country's economy. Health officials have said this week is crucial in the battle to contain MERS, as many of those in quarantine are near the end of their mandatory isolation period.

        <titulo>Queen Elizabeth marks official birthday with parade - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with a spectacular military parade and awards for actors, sportsmen and sportswomen, business leaders and community workers. The queen's actual birthday is on April 21 -- when the British monarch this year turned 89. But in line with tradition, her birthday is also celebrated on a summer Saturday when the weather is likely to be better for the parade, known as Trooping the Colour. The queen was joined by her husband, Prince Philip, and other members of the royal family for the ceremony in central London, led this year by the Welsh Guards. After the parade, the queen joined other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast by the Royal Air Force. At that point, Prince George, now a month from his second birthday, stole the show as he made his first balcony appearance in the arms of his father, Prince William. His mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, earlier made her first public appearance since the birth of Princess Charlotte on May 2, riding in a carriage with Prince Harry and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The queen's first Trooping the Colour was in 1953, shortly after her coronation. The queen also makes use of her official birthday to award honors to members of the public for their service to the nation. This year, recipients in the public eye include U.S. actor and director Kevin Spacey, recognized for his contribution over a decade as artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London; actor and charity fundraiser Lenny Henry; and Northern Irish musician Van Morrison. Another to be honored is journalist Caroline Criado-Perez, who in 2013 petitioned to have women displayed on British banknotes, prompting a storm of Twitter abuse. </corpo>

        <titulo>Sweden's Prince Carl Philip marries Sofia Hellqvist - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-13T18:23:49Z</data>
        <autor>Laura Smith-Spark, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It's the stuff of modern-day fairy tales. A handsome Swedish prince is marrying his Cinderella on Saturday -- only this time, his bride-to-be is a former model and reality-TV star-turned-charity organizer. Prince Carl Philip, 36, who is third in line to the Swedish throne, will wed Sofia Hellqvist in the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace of Stockholm. Swedish media reports have made much of 30-year-old Hellqvist's decidedly nontraditional past, including her appearance on the Swedish edition of reality TV show "Paradise Hotel" in 2005 and a reportedly risque photo shoot for Swedish men's magazine "Slitz." Hellqvist subsequently pursued business-related studies in New York and, while there, also qualified as a yoga instructor. She has more recently focused her efforts on charitable work. In 2010, she jointly founded the nonprofit organization Project Playground, which helps vulnerable children and young people in South Africa's townships. She remains honorary chairwoman of the charity, which also counts Prince Carl Philip as an honorary board member. To mark their wedding, the prince and Hellqvist have set up their own joint charitable venture, the Prince Couple's Foundation, again intended to help disadvantaged children, according to a palace news release. The guest list for the wedding includes royals from a half-dozen European nations and Princess Takamado of Japan. The wedding celebrations began with a private dinner for guests on Friday. After the ceremony on Saturday, guests will enjoy a banquet and dancing at the palace. The couple's engagement was announced in June last year. "We are looking forward to a summer wedding in the middle of June, when Sweden is extremely beautiful," they were quoted as saying then in a press release from the palace. "This will be a big day for us, and we are absolutely delighted." </corpo>

        <titulo>Actor John Stamos of 'Full House' fame arrested on DUI - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-13T18:26:38Z</data>
        <autor>Joe Sutton, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)John Stamos -- the Hollywood heartthrob known for his roles on "Full House" and "ER"-- was pulled over in Beverly Hills, California, then taken to a nearby hospital where he was arrested for having allegedly driven under the influence, police said. Police got involved after getting numerous calls about a possible drunken driver, Beverly Hills police Sgt. David Armour said. The 51-year-old actor -- the only person in his vehicle -- was pulled over, after which he showed officers his driver's license and identified himself verbally. Paramedics transported him to an area hospital due to a possible medical condition, according to Armour. Once at the hospital, authorities came to the conclusion that he'd been driving under the influence and arrested him, the police sergeant said. Stamos was given a citation for DUI and released to the care of the hospital. According to Armour, Stamos is set to appear in court September 11 in connection with the incident. While he didn't comment on the DUI allegation, the actor did tweet Saturday that he'd been released from custody and the hospital. "Thanks to everyone for their love &amp; support," Stamos wrote. "I'm home &amp; well. Very appreciative of the (Beverly Hills police) &amp; Cedars (hospital) for their care." Since his first role on the soap opera "General Hospital" in 1983, Stamos has been a mainstay in Hollywood. He held one-time and recurring roles in a number of TV shows before his big break playing "Uncle Jesse" on the sitcom "Full House" alongside the Olsen twins and Bob Saget, Stamos has kept very busy since that show went off the air in 1995, including roles in the TV series "Thieves," "Jake in Progress," "ER," and "Necessary Roughness." And he is set to star in the upcoming Fox series "Grandfathered," according to the Internet Movie Database. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Race of Rachel Dolezal, Spokane NAACP head, questioned - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-13T15:56:42Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Brumfield and Greg Botelho, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)The race of one of the most prominent faces in Spokane, Washington's black community is under question after her estranged mother claimed she is white but is "being dishonest and deceptive with her identity." Rachel Dolezal, 37, is the head of the local chapter of the NAACP and has identified herself as at least partly African-American. But her Montana birth certificate says she was born to two parents who say they are Caucasian. The parents shared that document and old photos with CNN. "We are her birth parents," Lawrence Dolezal told CNN on Friday. "We do not understand why she feels it's necessary to misrepresent her ethnicity." CNN tried to reach Rachel Dolezal for comment by emailing and calling her, but was unsuccessful. The Spokane Spokesman-Review. newspaper reported, though, that she has framed the controversy surrounding her racial identity in the context of litigation over guardianship of her adopted brother. According to court documents obtained by CNN, Rachel Dolezal's adopted brother, who is black, sought emancipation from Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal in 2010. The adopted brother, now 21, said the Dolezals used "physical forms of punishment" and had sent his brother and sister away to group homes because they didn't cooperate with the couple's religion and rules. The adopted brother wanted to live with Rachel Dolezal "in a multiracial household where black culture is celebrated and I have a connection to the black community," the court papers said. The papers did not specify Rachel Dolezal's race. The petition for emancipation was dropped. In a separate legal action in 2010, the court appointed Rachel Dolezal to be the adopted brother's guardian with the consent of Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal. On Friday, the Dolezals told CNN they didn't want to comment on a possible "legal dispute" their daughter or the NAACP had mentioned. One organization that appears to be standing behind her is the NAACP. The group, historically one of the most prominent in supporting causes important to the African-American community, said Friday that Dolezal is "enduring a legal issue with her family" and that "we respect her privacy in this matter." "One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership," the group said. "The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal's advocacy record."  Dolezal represented herself as African-American -- along with several other ethnicities, including white and Native American -- in an application for a Spokane police ombudsman commission. And she has presented the public with a different family photograph posted to the local NAACP chapter's Facebook page. When she announced her father was coming to town for a visit, she showed herself standing next to an older African-American man. Dolezal's public racial identity came under scrutiny on Thursday, when a reporter from CNN affiliate KXLY held up that photo asked her if it showed her dad. She replied that it did. Then came a follow-up question: "Are you African-American?" "I don't understand the question of -- I did tell you that, yes, that's my dad. And he was unable to come in January," Dolezal responded. "Are your parents -- are they white?" came the next query. Dolezal walked away from the microphone, leaving her purse and keys, and took refuge in a nearby clothing boutique.  Dolezal has built a wide-ranging career as an expert on and advocate for the black community. She is not just president of her local NAACP chapter; she is also an academic expert on African-American culture and teaches many related classes at Eastern Washington University. She represents the black community publicly and vocally, including as a spokeswoman on race-influenced police violence. On Tuesday she spoke to Al Jazeera on the topic. And Dolezal has appeared alongside Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who has filed charges against police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man. The mayor of Spokane appointed Dolezal chairwoman of a police oversight committee to keep an eye on fairness in police work. After the allegations of faked racial identity surfaced, Mayor David Condon and City Council President Ben Stuckart said they take "very seriously the concerns raised regarding the chair of the independent citizen police ombudsman commission." The city is checking to see if she has violated any policies. Still, what Dolezal has done is more important than what race she is to the NAACP, regional President Gerald Hankerson said. He called the NAACP a civil rights organization first that includes "leaders from all different ethnicities," adding that it "doesn't do a genealogy search on what a person's ethnicity is when they" take a top position. As to Dolezal specifically, Hankerson said, "We represent all civil rights issues, regardless of a person's ethnicity. And the quality of the work that she has done to elevate the issues of civil rights in that region is what we applaud." Dolezal has said she's been harassed in Spokane because of her race and activism. In September 2009, she told Spokane police she found a noose on her front porch a few days after her house was burglarized, according to a police report. Dolezal said she had numerous problems with the Aryan Nation and other hate groups because of her job and "biracial heritage," the report said. "I spent a lot of time in Mississippi so when I saw that rope, I knew what it was," she said in an article in the Coueur d'Alene Press. In February she reported finding an unnerving letter in the post office box for the NAACP. The police report said the envelope contained copies of news articles, prints of old photos of lynching victims and quotes about socialism and the New World Order. The letter contained no direct threats against Dolezal or the NAACP, police said. Police haven't made arrests in either of the cases.  Rachel Dolezal grew up in what her parents called a diverse family, with friends from various ethnicities and four adopted siblings who were black. She was "always interested in ethnicity and diversity" growing up, her mother Ruthanne Dolezal said. Dolezal attended college in Mississippi, then went on to Howard University on scholarship -- not having identified herself black then on her application, because there was no such option, though people there may have assumed as much "because her portfolio of art was all African-American portraiture," her mother said. It wasn't until around 2007, her parents said, that Dolezal began identifying herself more with the African-American community, according to her mother. Her parents say Rachel Dolezal "has chosen to distance herself from the family." "She has not explained to us why she is doing what she is doing and being dishonest ... with her identity," Ruthanne Dolezal said. Rachel Dolezal wouldn't answer the Spokesman-Review's questions about her racial heritage directly and said she wanted to talk to local NAACP leadership first. "I feel like I owe my executive committee a conversation," she said. "That question is not as easy as it seems," Dolezal told the Spokesman-Review. "There's a lot of complexities ... and I don't know that everyone would understand that." The NAACP, it seems, wasn't about to disqualify her if she's indeed white. "In every corner of this country," the group said, "the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational and economic justice for all people. And we encourage Americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization."  The story riled up many on social media, with Dolezal's name and the term "transracial" becoming top trending hashtags on Twitter. Some users raised the idea of racial passing, in which a person of one race acts as if they belong to another. Others floated the notion that people could cross over lines of racial identity as they do with sexual identity. "Hmm interesting article about #racheldolezal. If she identifies as black, can she be transracial?" one user asked. Other users compared Dolezal with Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, often in a derogatory manner. But many users, particularly African-Americans, bemoaned that switching race doesn't work like switching gender, noting that black people can't pretend to be white to avoid discrimination. "My prob w/ #Transracial: Black folk cant decide to be white when the cops raid their pool party. But a white woman can be NAACP president," wrote hip-hop artist Lizzo. "If #RachelDolezal can do it, so can I. I am now a white American. Give me: good credit, the ability to swim, and police NOT beating me," PrestonMitchum tweeted. "It's not just her appropriation. It's that she claimed an oppression that wasn't hers," wrote user Charles Clymer. Yet Hankerson -- the top NAACP official for Washington state as well as Oregon and Alaska -- questioned how much her race should really matter and whether this debate was worth having. "It's unfortunate that this has become a trending conversation," he said, "when there's a lot more important things that are going on in America that we should be better addressing."

        <corpo>(CNN)A group of armed insurgents attacked a police post in southern Afghanistan, killing 17 officers and wounding two others, an official said Saturday. The attack happened around 11 p.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Friday in the Musa Qala district of Helmand province, according to Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Zwak said investigators have been dispatched to the area to find out more about the incident, including how many insurgents, if any, died in the gunfight. Such violence, unfortunately, has plagued Afghanistan for years. Much of it has been spearheaded by the Taliban, the Islamist militant group forced out of power by the U.S.-led invasion following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks but still very much a disruptive force in the Asian nation. Many of the Taliban's targets have been police, troops and government workers. Still, it's not the only militant group to make claims: ISIS said it was behind the deaths of at least 33 people in Jalalabad, where a man on a motorbike blew himself up in front of a Kabul Bank branch. Still, while the latest attack in Helmand aligns with that history, it was not immediately clear who was behind it. This bloodshed has affected many parts of Afghanistan. Earlier this month, militants killed nine aid workers in an attack on a house in Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, according to Abdul Razaq Qaderi, chief of that province's criminal department. And in late May, four Taliban fighters were killed after launching an hours-long gun and grenade attack in an upscale district of central Kabul. No civilians or security forces died in that incident, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi told CNN. In Helmand province, a car bomb targeting the governor's compound killed at least seven people and wounded 46 in March, then-Deputy Governor Jan Rasoolyar said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group was responsible for that attack. </corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

        <titulo>MH370 possibly plunged straight into ocean, expert says - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-12T17:01:27Z</data>
        <autor>Michael Martinez and Don Melvin, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It has been 15 months since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing did an unexplained about-face, flew in the wrong direction and disappeared without a trace with 239 souls on board. In the absence of physical evidence, theories on what happened to the plane continue to proliferate: The crew passed out. It was pilot suicide. Or was it a paranormal event? Now comes the latest contribution to the debate: This week, a mathematician from Texas A&amp;M University announced that he had run data through a computer and determined it was likely the plane had plunged vertically into the ocean. Goong Chen, using "applied mathematics, computational fluid dynamics and numerical simulations of a Boeing 777 in a classic 'water entry' problem," determined that a plane that piercing vertically into the sea would not break apart. Simply put, a plane hitting the water at an angle would scatter its parts across the surface of the water. But one hitting at a near-vertical angle would shoot into the water with minimal damage and zoom straight to the bottom. Never mind that the Indian Ocean is more than seven times the size of the United States -- a rather large area to search. The theory of the vertical dive, said Chen and his colleagues, explains why no debris has been found. The study was published in the April 2015 issue of Notices of the American Mathematical Society. Chen offers no theories on why the plane might have been in a vertical descent. And he does offer a caveat. "The true final moments of MH370 are likely to remain a mystery until someday when its black box is finally recovered and decoded," he writes. But that has not stopped theories to sprout like weeds in an untended garden. Among those that have been circulated:  Some speculation has centered on the so-called "zombie theory" advanced by aviation specialist Clive Irving of The Daily Beast. A ghost plane is one where everyone aboard -- pilots, crew, passengers -- loses consciousness because of a loss of pressurization, an explosion, smoke or fumes. Under this supposition, the Malaysia plane continued to fly for hours on autopilot until it ran out of fuel. In 1999, a Lear jet carrying professional golfer Payne Stewart and four others crashed in South Dakota after flying on its own for four hours. All aboard had died when the cabin lost pressure. "I think in the first few minutes of this emergency, the pilots had to change course because they were looking for an emergency airport," Irving said about the Malaysian flight. "They were at some point overtaken by whatever it was, smoke, fire, or some kind of problem. And the plane was then left to fly itself after it had been programmed to go on that course." CNN aviation analyst Les Abend considers the thesis "very viable." "It can happen insidiously if it's a slow situation," Abend said. "But my scenario is a smoldering fire that created smoke and once that smoke began the crew donned their oxygen masks." The plane's captain may have "realized it was compelling enough to get the airplane turned and entered a waypoint that was an alternate airport in the flight management computer and kept the autopilot connected because this plane is designed, especially in an emergency situation to reduce workload," Abend said.  The crew may have become incapacitated and unable to land the plane, said former pilot Alastair Rosenschein, causing the plane to crash in the south Indian Ocean, where numerous searches have taken place. With the crew incapacitated, none of the passengers would have had the ability to control the plane or issue a distress call. If the plane ran out of fuel while on autopilot, the landing at sea would have the same path as one on land, said Mitchell Casado, a Boeing 777 pilot trainer. "It's not going to be any dramatic nose down or turning or anything like that. It's just going to be a very gentle, gradual descent -- very similar, actually, to what you would experience in a regular flight," Casado said. "Just a very gradual descent but constant until you hit the ground."  Malaysian military radar registered dramatic altitude changes for Flight 370 -- rising to 45,000 feet and then descending to 23,000 feet -- as it moved across Malaysia, according to a senior U.S. official. The official cautioned that the readings are not believed entirely accurate. Still, analysts surmise causes for the altitude changes. "Some of the flight profile changes might suggest that the flight was commandeered," said Robert Goyer, editor-in-chief of Flying magazine and a commercial jet-rated pilot. "Was it by one of the pilots or by an intruder? It would be more likely that it was ... by one of the pilots."  Inevitably, attention turns to whether the pilot or co-pilot tried to destroy the aircraft. Those theories can only grow more insistent in the wake of the crash of a Germanwings plane in the French alps earlier this year, in which the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, is believed to have downed the plane deliberately in a mass murder-suicide. Among the disturbing circumstances of MH370's disappearance is that its transponder and communication systems were off shortly after takeoff. Some experts have advanced the possibility that the pilots or crew were bent on the annihilation of everyone aboard the plane. "It's my belief that there was probably some type of struggle in the cockpit where it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane," said Mark Weiss, a retired American Airlines pilot captain who has flown the Boeing 777.  Some Internet users have ventured into the bizarre and paranormal. Some assert a meteor struck the plane. But the astronomical odds against such an event are high, to put it mildly. Lisa Williams, a psychic in California, said she believed the plane went down somewhere with its passengers still alive, though she doesn't have proof. "I do believe that it actually crashed and I see a lot of trees . . . " Williams said. "I also believe there was a hijacking." But Abend, the aviation analyst, dismissed Williams' speculation. "With(out) disparaging Lisa's profession, I mean, listen, I'm an airline pilot. I deal in black and white," Abend said. "It's difficult for me to, in this particular circumstance, to think that a psychic could solve a problem that people all over the world are not able to solve at this point." Underwater search for MH370 could end next year CNN's Tom Watkins and Matt Smith contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi forces: 'We don't need training, we need weapons' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Al-Mazraa, Iraq (CNN)Al-Mazraa is a dusty village just south of Baiji, where a battle is raging between ISIS fighters and pro-government Iraqi forces trying to push them out. Under normal circumstances it's a sleepy farming town just off the Saddam Hussein-era highway linking Baghdad and Mosul. Today it's a staging point for pro-government forces heading into nearby Baiji. Battered, bullet-pocked Humvees and armored pick-up trucks rumble through the trash-strewn main street, while young soldiers and militiamen mill around in the shade seeking relief from the brutal mid-day heat. A few residents mix with the fighters, including little boys curious about all the newcomers. A month ago Al-Mazraa, a village of Sunni Arabs, was in the hands of ISIS, but according to resident Ammer Hashd Jraish, their hands were light. "They would drive through here, but never stopped here," he says. Today Jraish, a man in his late forties with the ubiquitous dark moustache and sporting combat fatigues, is a member of the town council. He's a member of the Hashd Al-Shaabi, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), a Shia-led paramilitary force partially armed, trained and advised by Iran. Although a Sunni, he -- like many others in Al-Mazraa -- has taken up arms with the Shia-led PMU. Jraish insists he had nothing to do with ISIS during the year they controlled the area. I met him in the PMU's command center in Al-Mazraa, a sitting room in a villa full of chairs with maps on the walls and a big computer screen featuring another map of Baiji and the adjacent refinery. Sitting next to the screen is a man perhaps in his sixties with a trim white beard and white hair. It's Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, PMU's commander and arguably the most powerful military leader in Iraq. In this war where ironies abound, Al-Muhandis is on the U.S. government's list of designated terrorists for his involvement in the Iraqi insurgency, and for involvement in terrorist acts in Kuwait in the 1980s. But today he, like the United States, is fighting ISIS. CNN producer Hamdi Alkhshali and I introduce ourselves to Al-Muhandis, who initially declines our request for a quick on-camera interview. After a little coaxing, however, he begins to explain the situation in Baiji on one of the maps on the wall, quickly conceding that despite what we were told by Iraqi officials in Baghdad, pro-government forces only control about 50% of the town and still have a way to go before retaking the refinery, Iraq's largest. He is hesitant to be drawn on the United States and its role in the war on ISIS, brushing off questions with "it does not concern me" or "these are agreements between the Iraqi government and the United States." After much pressing, he expresses scorn. "It's clear," he says: "The international coalition isn't serious in its operations. That's why Ramadi fell." Others in the room, including the commander of Iraqi Army operations in Baiji, Major General Jumaa Anad, nod in agreement. Al-Muhandis points to the map, to a bridge over the Tigris River north of Baiji. "This bridge is on the main ISIS supply line between Baiji and Mosul. Every day for months now, fighters, equipment and ammunition move over this bridge. But until now the international coalition hasn't hit it." Major General Anad, a 37-year veteran of the Iraqi Army, expresses the consternation one hears from many in Iraq these days, noting that it took the U.S. and its allies only 22 days to utterly defeat Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. "When the United States wants to do something, it does it," he tells me. "We fought them twice, in 1991 and 2003. They have incredible capabilities. If they were serious, they could crush ISIS." When I ask him his reaction to the news that the Obama administration will send more than 400 additional troops to train the Iraqi Army, supplementing the around 3,100 already here, he scoffs. "We don't need training, we need weapons. To detect land mines we are using sticks, just like in World War One. The Americans have the latest technology for land mines. That's the kind of help we need." We didn't get a very close look at the fighting in Baiji. Mid-afternoon we ended up on the rooftop of a house commandeered by Sunni PMU fighters about 2.5 kilometers east of the town center. The house was littered with half-eaten meals of rice and meat, hundreds of empty water bottles, clothing strewn all over the place. In one of the rooms a young man applies a bandage to his leg. Explaining the lay of the land before us, local Sunni commander Khalil Awa says, "until now there are skirmishes with the remnants of ISIS, while others are fleeing toward Mosul." Others on the rooftop tell us the ISIS fighters, whom they listen in to on their walkie-talkies, are a mixture of Chechnyans, Central Asians and Iraqis from Mosul. From the rooftop we could hear small arms fire coming from Baiji, and an occasional thud, but could make out little else, everything is second-hand. The haze is too thick. </corpo>

        <titulo>China: Brave new world for spy thrillers? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T05:01:45Z</data>
        <autor>Jemimah Steinfeld, for CNN</autor>
        <corpo>London (CNN)China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. Western authors say its rise has been pure gold for suspense novels, filling a gaping hole left by the end of the Cold War. China has its own pack of spy novelists too. "The mysterious side of China certainly lends itself to thriller writing," says novelist Adam Brookes. The second installment of his critically acclaimed Night Heron trilogy, a spy yarn set between China and the UK, will debut this month. "Consider: China has emerged as a global power, yet we do not know how Xi Jinping engineered his rise to the leadership. We barely understand the country's core mechanisms!" he says. "So we spy, to find out. And suddenly you have all sorts of dramatic possibilities." In August, Mai Jia, nicknamed China's John le Carré, sees the UK publication of "In the Dark" -- his follow up to his codebreaking and counterespionage novel "Decoded." These are just the latest developments in a wider publishing tale: a growing interest in Asia, and in particular China, as a setting for tales of intrigue.  After the Cold War, writers spent years mourning the loss of old enemies and looking for new ones. They flirted with corporations and took on the Middle East. Yet they struggled to find something that really stuck. "It was easy for le Carré and people like that -- they had Russia. They were the obvious enemy," says Paul French, author of murder mystery "Midnight in Peking." Enter China, a former Cold War foe, which remains Communist by name and secretive by nature and it's no surprise that a growing number of acclaimed spy writers are traveling east in search of inspiration. Charles McCarry, one of the U.S.' most respected writers of spy fiction chose China for his 2013 hit: "The Shanghai Factor." It follows a young U.S. agent and his relationship with a mysterious woman named Mei, who is supposedly working for Chinese intelligence. The novel works both as light entertainment and as a more serious metaphor of the increasingly complicated relationship between China and the U.S.  For some, China's characteristic imperviousness is a major obstacle. Can foreign writers get the level of access needed for a great spy novel? "They won't even let foreigners into the Beijing naval museum without a Chinese ID card!" says French. For others, its impenetrable nature is a playground. U.S. journalist Alex Berenson, who set his second spy novel "The Ghost War" on a conflict between the US and China, admitted he left China without a deep understanding of Chinese Communist Party protocol. "Those doors stayed closed to me, as they do to nearly all Westerners," he wrote in the New York Times. "But the opacity that maddens the reporters is manna for novelists, and the novelist in me had a fine time imagining what might be happening behind closed doors in Beijing." China's weird and widely popular workplace novels  Contemporary Chinese writers are catching on too. For Charlotte Middlehurst, books editor at Time Out China, this represents a significant departure from the past. While thrillers, in particular detective stories, have long been popular in China (Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes are big hits), Chinese writers have penned few themselves. "Up until recently the number of foreigners writing spy thrillers set in China has far outweighed that of local writers," Middlehurst says. Not anymore. China now has its own pack-- Xiaolong Qui and He Jiahong for example. "They, along with other writers, most notably Mai Jia, have taken the thriller genre and added Chinese characteristics turning it into something altogether more unique." Middlehurst attributes the trend partly to the rise of social media, which has facilitated online fanzines and reader communities. She also believes President Xi's recent crackdown on corruption "has resonated deeply with readers and authors" as previously off bound topics have become more openly talked about. READ: Profiting from China's banned books  Not all are convinced that China will become literary villain number one though. Spy fiction in the UK and U.S. at least is still dominated by tried-and-tested tropes. Readers like established archetypes. And foreign language books generally struggle to reach these audiences, not least books from or set in China. The culture remains confusing, the history unexplored and the language totally baffling. "When the landscape is so unfamiliar, many readers are wary of plunging into it," says Brookes. "I have tried with "Night Heron" to walk the commercial fiction reader into China and keep them oriented, but it's a hard trick to pull off." "And I think many thriller writers will see renewed strategic rivalries with Russia, the threat of global jihadism and terrorism as more accessible sources of locale and plot," he says. Despite this Brookes is optimistic. "China is the great strategic story of our time, and everybody should be making some effort to get to grips with it," he says. If China doesn't yet have a license to thrill, it's only a matter of time.

        <corpo>(CNN)It's safe to say few tears have been shed by women in science over the resignation of Nobel-winning scientist Sir Tim Hunt after his now infamous comments regarding his experience of "girls" in laboratories. "Three things happen when they are in the lab; you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them, they cry," Hunt said, prompting outcry, then condemnation and now mirth. On Twitter, the "girls" of science are doing their best to prove how #distractinglysexy they are, by posting pictures of themselves at work. Some are even seen posing with poop. Anne Hilborn tweets: "I was so #distractinglysexy when collecting cheetah crap that even I lost track of what I was doing and dropped some." And cows. "Here I am shoulder-deep in cow rectum, so seductive!" tweets Vanessa Adams. Alongside photos of herself wearing protective gear and heavy boots, Twitter user @xLiserx laments, "Guess I can't save the lives of my geological counterparts - I'm too #distractinglysexy to the team. As if!" Charlene Blomquist, who describes herself as a science nerd, said she had posted the only photo she had of herself "where my mascara isn't running from all the crying." University College of London announced Hunt's resignation on Wednesday, with a brief statement saying: "UCL can confirm that Sir Tim Hunt FRS has today resigned from his position as Honorary Professor with the UCL Faculty of Life Sciences, following comments he made about women in science at the World Conference of Science Journalists on 9 June." "UCL was the first university in England to admit women students on equal terms to men, and the university believes that this outcome is compatible with our commitment to gender equality." Steve Diggle, a microbiologist from the University of Nottingham stepped in with a ready-made sign to address Hunt's concerns about coed labs. "Caution: Mixed Gender Lab! No falling in love or crying permitted" After the initial outcry, Hunt apologized in an interview with the BBC for any offense his comments had caused, but said that he stood by them. "I did mean the part about having trouble with girls. It is true that people -- I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field," he said. "I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult. "I'm really, really sorry I caused any offense, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually," he added. Some came to Hunt's defense, questioning whether his resignation amounted to a curb on free speech. "Seems London's Professors are not allowed free speech at UCL as #TimHunt resigns. It's all @uclnews to me," tweeted Barbara Cookson, a European patent lawyer and IP expert. Hunt was part of the team that won the Nobel Prize in physiology in 2001 for the discovery of key regulators of the cell cycle.

        <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home. She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village. During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came. "I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me." Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety. She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband. Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram. The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of. "People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion." It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant. The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy. "We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women. In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations. On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst. "Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughter‎ and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house." She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter. "We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone." Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats. The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN. "I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes." In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will. When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it. Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.

        <titulo>Chinese feminists show off armpit hair in photo contest - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T15:01:44Z</data>
        <autor>Wilfred Chan and Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard." </corpo>

        <titulo>Architects design 'world's tallest' wooden skyscraper - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-12T10:18:06Z</data>
        <autor>Eoghan Macguire, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Forget steel and concrete. The new material of choice for skyscrapers could be wood if Canadian architect Michael Green has his way. Green's Vancouver-based MGA firm along with French architectural partners DVVD and real estate group REI France recently proposed what they claim would be the tallest wooden building in the world for Reinventer Paris, a design competition which sought new ideas for revitalizing architecture in the city. At 35-storeys tall, the tower at the center of the "Baobab" complex -- which also includes a student hotel, green space, bus station and e-car hub -- aims to help solve the French capital's housing challenges in a sustainable, creative and environmentally-friendly manner. Some within the project have even compared the concept to the Eiffel Tower in the iconic structures stakes. According to Green, the Eiffel Tower had a huge impact in inspiring architects to build with steel when it debuted as the world's tallest structure in 1889. Now he hopes Baobab can do the same. "Eiffel's vision redefined the skylines of the world, eventually (starting) the race for height in places like New York and Chicago in the 1920's and 30's and even... (in) new global cities in Asia and the Middle East today," Green told CNN via email. "We love the idea that a wood tower in Paris, however modest in some respects ... will help champion a new global wave of building with more sustainable, renewable and beautiful materials," he added.  The idea of a "plyscraper" may sound far fetched to those unfamiliar with the concept and there are currently no plans to construct the MGA building in Paris. But tall wooden buildings are an architectural development being given increasingly serious consideration in a number of locations around the world. Work is set to begin on the HoHo building, a 275-foot structure made almost entirely from wood in the Austrian capital of Vienna next year. Meanwhile, a 34-storey wooden apartment block could be built in Stockholm by 2023 if architecture firm C.F Moller has its way. MGA has already built the 97-foot tall Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. Other ambitious wood buildings have also sprung up in the likes of Australia and the United Kingdom too. The advantages of wood include its dexterity as a building material as well as its strong environmental credentials. Cross laminated timber -- a multiple panel wood product that is used to form the likes of walls, roof and floor panels -- in particular is has quickly established itself as a strong, reliable and popular wooden building material. "Wood, unlike steel and concrete, sequesters carbon dioxide, storing it away for the life of the building it is in," Green said. "As a renewable material grown by the power of the sun, wood offers us a new way to think about our future." Promotional literature relating to Baobab states it would store an estimated 3,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That's equivalent to keeping 2,207 cars off the road for a year or operating a home for 982 years, MGA state. The tower would also be constructed using a prefabricated construction method, where components are measured and built in a factory, often with space for doors, windows and wiring already carved into panels, before being rapidly transported and put together on site. This could potentially reduce cost, disruption and build time.  On the downside, however, critics say the drawbacks of large wooden structures include the potential for increased fire hazard and the fact that economies of scale are not quite there yet to make it massively cheaper than the likes of steel and concrete. Reports earlier this year suggested the Vienna fire department was liaising with the architectural firm behind the HoHo building to figure out how to minimize the blaze risk. Green confirms building such ambitious structures with timber would mean "reinventing wood; making it stronger, more fire safe, more durable and selecting material from sustainably managed forests." This last point is particularly relevant if wood is to fulfill its promise as a sustainable material. An efficient supply chain that replenished wood at a similar rate to which it was used would be a basic requirement. Then there are the difficulties of introducing new materials and designs into a model for building that's already relatively efficient and cost-effective. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, told CNN earlier this year that shear walls -- the central core of tall buildings -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel for the foreseeable future. Dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material, he said, wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. Green pointed out that all MGA wooden buildings so far have been built with "central elevator cores in mass timber." Although he added that the foundations have been made in concrete and steel has been used to make connections between the wood. However, Lawrence also pointed out that building with wood can still have its benefits if carefully planned out. "What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset," Lawrence says. "You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes." "If you leave the wood exposed, you can (also) have a really nice environment inside the building," he says. As Green and MGA suggest, there would better no location to put wood's aesthetic and structural fortitude to the test than the picturesque city of Paris. Read: The most ambitious luxury home ever?

        <titulo>How education shapes children's lives - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>The CNN Freedom Project wants to amplify the voices of the victims of modern-day slavery, highlight success stories and help unravel the tangle of criminal enterprises trading in human life. (CNN)What has education helped you achieve? That was the question the CNN Freedom Project posed to Twitter users in the run up to World Against Child Labor Day on June 12, which this year focuses on how education can help end the cycle of poverty and underage workers. The answers were as diverse as the respondents with your tweets showing just how much of an impact education has had on lives the world over. To highlight the importance of education, we asked you to share your old school photos. People from all walks of life got involved, telling the world how education helped them get to where they are now.  According to the International Labour Organization, 120 million children between the ages of five and 14 are involved in child labor, with some 98 million working in agriculture. For many of those children, going to school is impossible. Others have to fit their education around their work, making it harder to get skills they need to find decent jobs as adults. The result is that their own children in turn may need to work to support the family. Conversely, if children receive quality education up until legal employment age, they are much less likely to fall into poverty -- and if they are well employed as adults, they will not have to rely on their children to bring in additional income. That's why the CNN Freedom Project is highlighting the value of education. CNN anchors got involved with the initiative too, showing us how far they have come, thanks to a good education. "Education helped me to have lots of opportunities. My sports broadcast career began at university," said sports anchor and correspondent Alex Thomas. While CNN's Isa Soares said education helped her to "be insatiably curious, creative and critical."

        <titulo>Can Thai fishing industry tackle its slavery problem? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-17T13:46:14Z</data>
        <autor>Dean Irvine, Saima Mohsin, and Kocha Olarn, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has told CNN that slave labor in his country's fishing industry "is now severe" and that Thailand will act to tackle it. CNN investigates the scale of the problem in this special report. (CNN)The hours would be long and the work hard, but spending a year as a fisherman seemed like a good option to Samart Senasook. Previous jobs as a security guard in Bangkok had been sporadic, so when a man known as Vee promised the 40-year old decent wages on a fishing boat he decided to take the chance. Vee turned out to be a broker, a link in the chain of human trafficking that supplies the Thai fishing industry with thousands of migrant workers and turns many of them into virtual slaves. Instead of a year on board a Thai fishing vessel, Senasook said he spent six, and was made to work 20-hour days in life-threatening conditions. His unwanted odyssey only came to an end last month, thousands of miles from Thailand, on the eastern Indonesian island of Ambon. The boat he was on was impounded by Indonesian authorities for suspected illegal fishing, with Senasook and his crewmates held in custody.  Looking back on his ordeal, that he says lasted from January 2009 to March 2015, Senasook rarely saw land, as the boat he was on roamed further and further from Thai waters in search of increasingly scarce fish. Its catch was part of Thailand's multi-billion dollar seafood industry that feeds tens of millions in Europe and the United States. Senasook describes his life on board as one full of intimidation, sleep deprivation and regular beatings from the boat's captain. "(The captain) kicked and punched me," he said. "My nose and mouth were bleeding. I still have blood clotted in my teeth. My jaw hurts every time I chew." With no way to escape, he became suicidal. "I was thinking of my family, my mother. There were times, I was about to jump into the sea to kill myself. "My friend from the engine room held me back. Otherwise I would have been dead by now," he said. Senasook says the boat's captain kept his and the crew's ID at all times, essentially holding them captive. When Senasook did finally get his hands on his identity card on Ambon, he was horrified to see it was in a false name. He had gone from being captive on board a fishing boat to being stranded on a distant island. "There are many of my friends die in Indonesia. And their graves were with wrong names," said Senasook. "Like, if I died, at my grave it would not bear my name but it would be someone else." In desperation, he wrote an open letter to the Thai Prime Minister asking for help. That helped to release him from Indonesian custody, but, isolated and penniless, he could not make his way home to Thailand. He received a final payment of 1,750 baht ($53) from his ship's captain, but was then told he needed to pay 20,000 baht ($615) for the agent fee that brought him on the boat in 2009.  Eventually he received assistance from Thai-based Labor Rights Promotion Network (LPN) and was repatriated to Thailand last month. He was one of the more fortunate ones. The LPN discovered a similar situation on the nearby island of Benjina, where the group says hundreds of other fishermen from across Southeast Asia were trapped and living in desperate conditions. The rights group estimates there could be up to 3,000 trafficked victims working on boats in these seas. "(The fishermen on Ambon and Benjina) have forged or no documents so can't return home," said the LPN's Patima Tangpratyakoon. "The situation is severe." But the problem of modern day slaves fishing for seafood that ends up on dinner plates on the other side of the world goes much further than these tiny Indonesian islands. The extent of the situation is hard to gauge. Thai government figures state that there are 145,000 working in its fishing industry, with 80% of those migrant workers, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. However, activist group Raks Thai Foundation suggests there are in excess of 200,000 trafficked, unregistered workers. The exact number of fishing vessels is also unknown -- official figures put them at around 57,000 -- because registration is lax. The real number could be double that.  The issue of slavery and rights abuses in the Thai fishing industry has become acute in recent years. As the global demand for seafood has increased, the Thai economy improved, so attracting workers to dangerous jobs on fishing boats has become more difficult. Last year the U.S. State Department downgraded Thailand to the lowest tier on its Trafficking in Persons Report 2014, which can result in the withdrawal of international aid. Last month the European Union called Thailand a "non-cooperating" country because of poor monitoring and control of its fishing vessels and the trade of fish and seafood from other countries into Thailand. Unless it cracks down on the situation, Thailand faces a financially damaging embargo on its fish exports to the EU from October. In response, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has declared combating human trafficking a national priority. In a statement in March, he called on all government agencies to "clean up their houses." Traffickers and government officials that have colluded with them "no longer have any room to exist in Thai society," he said. According to Thailand's Department of Fisheries, new control measures are being implemented. As well as inspections of fishing vessels, boats more than 30 tons in size that travel outside of Thai waters will have to be equipped with an electronic vessel monitoring system (VMS). Without it, the boats will not be given a fishing license. However, only around 6,000 boats in the Thai fishing fleet are of this size, according to the Marine Department. Another new government initiative that came into play in April requires each fishing vessel to list who is on board, who it is licensed to, the name of its owner, and where it will operate before it leaves port and once it returns. These "port-out, port-in" measures "will help enable us to reduce the risk of human trafficking, reduce the risk of force labor," said Warapon Prompol, deputy director-general, Department of Fisheries. Crew manifests were not previously required. "For the Marine Department we can check only a certain type of vessel, a certain size, too. But now the government is trying to reduce the size (of the vessel) that allows that we can check them," said Chula Sukmanop, director-general to the Marine Department. He added that enforcement is made more difficult because all too often ships will change crew once they leave port.  While laws against human trafficking exist in the country -- a new Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act was approved as recently as March -- it has often been this lack of enforcement that has allowed exploitation of fishermen to continue. "There have been laws that should penalize employers with penalties and not just the migrants themselves, but they've been rarely enforced in the past," said Max Tunon, senior program manager for the International Labour Organization, who specializes in migrant workers' rights in Southeast Asia. "This is the most attention there's been on the issue, coming from the highest level," he added. "There's a greater acknowledgment that corruption exists and that increasing regulation (of the industry) needs to be linked to the broader issues of migration." Exports by Thai seafood companies to the United States and Europe are worth around $2.5 billion annually, with Thai Union Frozen Products (TUF) one of the largest -- and owner of the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands. In a statement in March, Khun Thiraphong Chansiri, TUF's president and CEO, called human trafficking in its supply chain "utterly unacceptable," but said "we all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100% clean." Progress to combat the problems of trafficked workers and slave labor has been made thanks to market and trade pressure, said Tunon. But it's still hard to see real change on the ground. "It's been a challenge for years and it will be hard to measure progress because there has not been much of a baseline from which to gather credible information on the problem," said Tunon. "The attention is now on the fishing industry, as it's particularly vulnerable, but this could help better protection for migrant workers in sections that don't have consumer or trade pressure, that aren't so visible because they don't feed into the global supply chain." </corpo>

        <titulo>Slavery to doubt: An Eritrean migrant's story - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-15T16:18:10Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Wedeman, CNN International correspondent</autor>
        <corpo>Rome (CNN)"What are you doing here?" A man in a red t-shirt and a long black ponytail shouted angrily at us as we conducted interviews at a center for migrants -- most of whom were from Eritrea -- in the Rome suburb of Tiburtina. "You should be in Eritrea interviewing that demon there!" That "demon," the man went on to explain, is Isaias Afwerki, the country's president since 1993. The man told us he was from Eritrea and had been in Italy for eight years, but declined to be interviewed, fearing his relatives back home would be punished. Eritreans make up the second largest group of migrants, after Syrians, reaching the shores of Europe.  But unlike the Syrians, the Eritreans aren't fleeing war. Instead they are refugees from what human rights activists describe as a system of official slavery—open-ended military service for all males and unmarried females between the ages of 18 and 50. Benjamin, 23, comes from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. When we met him in a park in Ponte Mammolo in northern Rome, he had been in Italy for about eight days. "I ran away from Eritrea because I don't want to serve in the military," he told me. "I was hiding from place-to-place for a very long time. My family suffered too much trying to hide me. I had to move out. My destiny was to be in the military and that's not what I want. The only opportunity I have is running away." Benjamin spoke almost flawless English, which he taught himself while on the run. When we interviewed him, he asked that we not show his face. He was one of the few in the park who were willing to be interviewed at all. The day before Italian police had come in the morning with bulldozers and demolished a small shanty town of plywood and corrugated iron shacks that had housed around 200 migrants. Benjamin's "house" as he calls it, is a strip of cardboard he sleeps on under a tree. His story is similar to many we've heard from other migrants.  His family scraped together as much money as they could to pay what he described as "facilitators" to help him escape from Eritrea and travel across Ethiopia and Sudan to Libya, where he ended up in the town of Ajdabia. In Ajdabia, a town I spent lots of time in during the Libyan uprising in 2011, he stayed for a month in a house run by several facilitators, ironically, fellow Eritreans. The bonds of nationality didn't count for much. "He was a very terrible person," recalled Benjamin. "The only thing he wanted from us was money. He didn't feed us properly. To be honest I didn't take a shower for the full month I was in that house. You were allowed to go to the bathroom only one time a day." The facilitators "took our phones, they took everything we had in our pockets. I had €200. They took my wallet and my documents. All I had was the clothing I was wearing." Summing up the experience in Ajdabia, he said "it was the example of hell." From Ajdabia he and other Eritrean migrants were moved to the Libyan capital, Tripoli. There they were crammed with around 600 others onto a two-level fishing boat. "The engine burned out two or three times and the fan belt also broke. We stayed in the middle of nowhere for seven hours," he told me. "Everybody gave up on that boat," he said. "We were just praying to God to help us. Some people were fighting there. Some people were sitting inside the engine room. Many were unconscious. It was too hot, and people were vomiting." Benjamin was in a cramped, suffocating room on the lower deck. "I was vomiting from the time I got onto the boat. It was so crowded, but I sat on top of my friend and had my face in a little window where I could breathe. I don't remember what happened after that. I was just feeling my pain." After around 13 hours at sea, he heard a helicopter overhead. Someone shut off the engine, and they waited until rubber dinghies from the Italian Navy came to their rescue.  The Navy took them first to a receiving center on the island of Lampedusa, and then they were moved to another center in Sicily. "After we reach Sicily, they start forcing the people to be fingerprinted so we decided to run away," he said. According to European Union regulations, migrants must be registered in the country they arrive in, and cannot go on to request asylum elsewhere. To avoid being registered, he and his friends left the center, saying they were going to a nearby church. "And once we went outside we never went back," he said. With help from friends, who gave him €50, he said he was able to get to Rome, with €7 left over. In Ponte Mammalo, local churches provided him and other migrants with food and clothing. Benjamin's goal is eventually get to Germany, where he hopes to get an education and a "better life." He has no relatives there, speaks no German, but clings to the vague hope that somehow he will land on his feet. "It's just me," he says with a smile. </corpo>

        <titulo>South Korea mulls reopening schools in MERS outbreak - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-13T06:35:41Z</data>

        <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The rate of contagion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has slowed in South Korea, a health official said Saturday, and may be on its way down. But the outbreak is not completely over. The outbreak has been "large and complex" and "more cases should be anticipated," an official told reporters. Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. The 68-year-old patient, who had just returned from four Middle Eastern countries, went from facility-to-facility before getting properly diagnosed. He would become "patient zero" of South Korea's outbreak of MERS, which has so far reported 138 cases. The outbreak has sparked international concern, shuttered more than 3,000 schools and stalled the country's economy. Fourteen people in South Korea have died after contracting MERS; however, all deaths have been among older adults with underlying medical conditions. Amid weeks of gloomy news, there seems to be gradual signs of easing as officials are mulling the reopening of schools and more people have been released from quarantine after testing negative. Health officials have said this week is crucial in the battle to contain MERS as many of those in quarantine are near the end of their mandatory isolation period.  The outbreak in South Korea has had ripples elsewhere around the world. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory, telling American health care providers to watch for MERS symptoms from people coming from South Korea or Middle East countries. Hong Kong and Macau raised travel alerts asking their residents to avoid unnecessary travel to South Korea. Passengers from South Korea to Hong Kong's airport are getting temperature checks. Hong Kong is particularly sensitive to the prospect of an outbreak as it endured hundreds of deaths from the SARS outbreak of 2002-3. But it has not been the only one. China, which also grappled with SARS, has also taken precautions. The Chinese aviation regulator ordered all airlines traveling to Korea to disinfect the plane more frequently, reported Xinhua. Also the organizers of the Shanghai Film Festival, which starts Saturday, emailed Korean participants to say they should cancel their trips due to MERS. The email "was only to provide suggestion," said Yang Xinwei, the festival's spokeswoman. The outbreak has also taken a toll on tourism to South Korea and affected industries such as transportation and restaurants in the country. 5 things to know about MERS  While South Korea has grappled with the outbreak for three weeks, there is some hope of containment. By Friday, 1,249 people had been released from quarantine after they tested negative for MERS. The number of people kept in quarantine has reduced to 3,680, a drop of 125 from the previous day. And schools may be re-opening next week as the Ministry of Health also said there is a "high possibility" of resuming classes. More than 2,700 schools were shut due to MERS on Friday. In a press conference, the Seoul School superintendent announced that all schools should make their own decisions whether to remain closed or not. Earlier this week, the WHO had recommended reopening them since there is no evidence of MERS circulating in schools and only one of over 100 cases has affected a teenager. An expert team assembled by the World Health Organization is scheduled to hold a news conference Saturday, releasing its assessment of the outbreak and the response in South Korea.

        <titulo>HRW: Another 50 lashes imminent for Saudi blogger - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-12T12:23:53Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Brumfield and Don Melvin, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Raif Badawi set up a website to express his views and those of others. For that he was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes with a whipping cane. To Saudi Arabian authorities, the blogger is a criminal. And for that, he is to be publicly flogged -- as happened in January, when he stoically arched his back in pain while getting 50 lashes. He's supposed to get 19 more rounds of such punishment, according to the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. The second batch of 50 lashes was supposed to come not long after the first, but it's been pushed back several times -- including Friday. Amnesty reported as much on Twitter, as did Badawi's wife Ensaf Haidar. "No flogging for today," Haidar wrote on her husband's Twitter account. "I repeat my appeal to his majesty King Salman to pardon my husband #RaifBadawi and stop his flogging."  Badawi has been behind bars since 2012 for his online posts and running a blog called "Saudi Arabian Liberals," where he hosted political and religious debate and advocated secularism in a highly religious society. In 2013, a court originally sentenced him to seven years and 600 lashes, but the punishment was upped upon appeal, Human Rights Watch has said. The sharper measures also includes a fine of about $265,000, the group said. The sentencing covers convictions for violating the kingdom's information technology law, insulting Islam, and according to HRW, "blasphemous phrases on his Facebook page and disobedience to his father." On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court upheld the sentence, now Badawi has no more appeals.  The lashings were supposed to happen about once a week for 20 weeks, in a place open to public viewing. A light wooden cane is used for the lashes, which are administered on the legs and back, HRW said. They usually leave bruises but don't often break the skin. But eight days after the initial flogging, doctors determined that Badawi's injuries had not healed sufficiently to be flogged for the second time, Amnesty International reported. Another round would be detrimental, they said. The second beating has been postponed many times, including on Friday. "His health is poor, and he cannot take another round of lashes," Badawi's wife, Haidar, told Amnesty then.  On top of health concerns, the first lashing ignited international outcry from human rights activists and from Western governments. Before the supreme court decision, U.S. officials had called on Saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review Badawi's case. Human Rights Watch said in protest at the time, "Publicly lashing a peaceful activist merely for expressing his ideas sends an ugly message of intolerance." CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <autor> By Oren Liebermann, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Jerusalem (CNN)The Israeli military announced on Thursday that it will not take any legal action against those involved in a deadly airstrike on a beach last year. The July 2014 attack on the Gaza City beach killed four boys, aged between 9 and 11, from the extended Bakr family. Their names were Ismail, Zakariya, Ahed and Mohammad. "The Military Advocate General found that the attack process in question accorded with Israeli domestic law and international law requirements. The decision to attack was taken by the competent authorities, and the attack was aimed at figures who were understood to be militants from Hamas's Naval Forces, who had gathered in order to prepare to carry out military activities against the IDF (Israel Defense Forces)," according to the report from the IDF military advocate general, Maj. Gen. Danny Efroni. Investigators interviewed IDF soldiers involved in planning and carrying out the attack, and they examined documents and video of the attack, according to the report. Investigators also tried to interview three Palestinian witnesses in Gaza, but the report says the witnesses declined to speak with investigators, instead offering affidavits. The location of the attack was known to be a compound of Hamas police and naval forces, which the IDF attacked multiple times in the days before the attack that killed the four children, according to the report. When IDF aerial surveillance spotted four people running towards a shed next to the compound, officials believed them to be Hamas militants, the report says. The IDF struck the area with two missiles, killing the children. "Tragically, in the wake of the incident it became clear that the outcome of the attack was the death of four children who had entered the military compound for reasons that remain unclear," the report states. There will be "no further legal proceedings" against those involved in the incident, according to the report, but "as a result of this incident, the IDF has been working to improve a number of its operational capabilities, including technological capabilities, in order to minimize the risk of the recurrence of tragic incidents of this kind," it says.  The IDF also issued indictments against three soldiers for looting a Palestinian home during the Gaza war. According to Efroni's report, the soldiers looted $350 from a home in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood in which they were staying. Two soldiers are charged with looting the home while a third is charged with obstruction of justice. Efroni opened three more criminal investigations, including one in which nine people were killed at a cafe on the Khan Younis coast on July 9. Investigators will also look into allegations of abuse against a Palestinian detainee who claims IDF forces assaulted him for no reason after he was captured, and into media reports of IDF tanks intentionally firing shells at a medical clinic. According to the report, the advocate general has looked into approximately 190 incidents from the Gaza war. Dozens of additional incidents remain under investigation. The last Gaza war began when three Israeli teens were abducted and murdered. Israel blamed Hamas. The retaliatory abduction and murder of a Palestinian teen wound tensions in the region to a fever pitch. There followed a dramatic escalation in the number of rockets Hamas was firing into Israel and after a failed attempt by militants to storm into its territory, Israel launched the so-called Operation Protective Edge. The war lasted 50 days and by the time a ceasefire was agreed, some 2,100 Palestinians, and 68 Israelis, mostly soldiers, had been killed.

        <titulo>Fame poses new risk for China's 'magic rabbit' - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-11T00:44:05Z</data>
        <autor>Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas. </corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi who has seen it all: ISIS in Mosul to stay - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T12:25:21Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Wedeman, CNN International Correspondent</autor>
        <corpo>Baghdad (CNN)We had just finished up our shoot in Al-Makasib Girls' Elementary School in Baghdad's Saadoun neighbourhood and were loading the gear into the car when a man sitting in a wheelchair across the courtyard beckoned to me. "Come, talk to me, too," he said. He introduced himself as Louay Hikmat Shawkat, Iraqi Army veteran of the war with Iran and then the 1991 Kuwait war, refugee from Mosul and a self-described translator of English, French, "Canadian" and "Yugoslavian." Given that the latter two aren't languages, and his English was a tad scratchy, I was intrigued. We were visiting the school to talk to its current "residents" -- 48 Christian families who had fled Mosul when ISIS took over a year ago. Mosul, in northern Iraq and one of the nation's largest cities, is about 405 kilometers (about 250 miles) from the capital of Baghdad. But for these internal refugees, it might as well be a world away. I asked Louay, who is 60, when he thought he might be able to return home.  "Take it out of your mind that ISIS is going to leave Mosul," he insisted, gesturing with his hand as if he were pulling a thread out of his head. The chances he and his wife will someday return to their home in the Mosul suburb of Hamdaniya, he said, are "one in a hundred. One in a million!" Louay said he suffers from diabetes, but he insists on lighting up another cigarette in his nicotine-stained fingers "because I get upset whenever I speak about "Da'ish", the Arabic acronym for ISIS. ISIS, he said, "is an illness. It's impossible to cure. Cancer can be cured, tuberculosis can be cured. Almost every illness can be cured, but not this one." His diabetes causes him to suffer from dizziness whenever he stands up. "If I were well," he vows, "I would go fight them myself." Like everyone else I spoke with at the school, he is desperate to leave Iraq, but his attempts to apply for asylum have come to naught. His last hope, he told me with a mischievous grin, is an old Canadian girlfriend in Montreal.  In the school's makeshift kitchen, I met Linda Jannan, who was busy with the washing up. She fled Mosul with her husband and three children in August, first going to Dohuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they spent six months in a tent in a refugee camp. A thin women in her 30s with the dark circles under her eyes, she also was desperate to leave Iraq. "We are finished," she told me. "Our future, our children, our men have been destroyed. We're too afraid to go out and find work. If only someone outside Iraq will help us find a solution, let us emigrate. We have no hope left." She and her husband had applied to asylum in the United States and Germany, but they were rejected because they have no close relatives in either country. Obama: No 'complete strategy' yet on training Iraqis Over the past few months, these refugees have been visited by a variety of reporters. And it's clear their patience is wearing thin. "What's the point of all this talk?" one man asked me, after declining my request for an on-camera interview. "We talk, we talk, and nothing happens," he snapped. Firyal Abdel Kareem, who was sharing the kitchen with Linda Jannan, is at her wits' end. She spent the winter months in a windy tent in Zakho, near the Turkish border, and is now suffering from Baghdad's sweltering summer heat. "Find a solution for us," she told me, "it's enough. We are tired." "Either they take us out of here, or send us home. Do we have to stay in this school, or in a tent?"  I've been covering Iraq since 1994. I covered the impact of the draconian international sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. I covered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the messy, bloody aftermath. And now I'm back covering the war against ISIS. I'm lucky. I come and go as I please. For the people in this school, there is no such luxury. Thair Al-Naim, his wife and their three young sons left behind a relatively comfortable life in Mosul last summer. He's now penniless and out of work, all his construction equipment seized and sold by ISIS. Speaking to him in the classroom they now call "home," I sense a deep weariness with a life that, for too long, has been fraught with violence and fear. "Since the fall of Saddam," he sighs, "all we've had is war after war, and now we have Da'ish." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>"Inside Space City," a world exclusive CNN interview with three of China's top astronauts, premieres on Saturday May 30 at 11:30 am HKT/ 3:30 am GMT Beijing (CNN)China wants greater cooperation with other nations in space, particularly the United States, the country's most experienced astronaut has told CNN in an exclusive interview. Fifteen nations including the United States, Russia and Japan cooperate on International Space Station missions, but China's involvement has always been a non-starter because of longstanding resistance from U.S. legislators. INTERACTIVE: IS CHINA WINNING THE SPACE RACE? "As an astronaut, I have a strong desire to fly with astronauts from other countries. I also look forward to going to the International Space Station," Commander Nie Haisheng told CNN. "...Space is a family affair, many countries are developing their space programs and China, as a big country, should make our own contributions in this field." The comments came during a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with the three-person crew of the Shenzhou-10 mission inside Space City, the center of China's space program, near Beijing last month. In 2011, Congress passed an act to bar NASA from having any bilateral contact with individuals of the Chinese space program because of national security fears. "Every time it gets mentioned at all anywhere near Congress, it gets shut down immediately," space analyst Miles O'Brien told CNN. "There is tremendous skepticism there about China. It is viewed as a foe, it is viewed as a government that seeks to take our intellectual property -- our national secrets and treasure." In a white paper released Tuesday, China said that outer space had become an area of "strategic competition." "The Chinese government has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space, it opposes space weaponization and an arms race in outer space. This position will not be changed," Wang Jin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said. MORE: NASA astronaut: We risk losing out to China  A recent report for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said China's improving space capabilities had "negative sum consequences for U.S. military security." But Nie discounted those fears. "The United States and Russia started their space programs early. They are the pioneers," he said. He says foreign astronauts are welcome to visit China's own space station once it is launched. The Chinese expect to finish their space station by 2022 -- around the time International Space Station runs out of funding, potentially leaving China as the only country with a permanent presence in space. China launched its manned space program in 1992. It initially borrowed and bought a great deal of Russian technology, primarily by replicating their Soyuz space craft -- which they dubbed the Shenzhou. But it has been steadily checking off the boxes in manned space flight. In 2003, it put its first man in space. In 2008, it completed its first space walk. And in 2013 Nie and his crew completed the country's longest space mission to date and twice docked with the Tiangong-1 space lab. MORE: Meet the crew of the Shenzhou-10  With support from the highest echelons of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and exceptionally deep pockets, most analysts believe China's space program could become a world leader. "I think in the end -- tortoise versus hare style, they will probably win," said O'Brien. In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth. Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia. Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions." While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon. However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program. "For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2 and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station." </corpo>

        <titulo>YSL ad with 'unhealthily' thin model banned in UK - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>London (CNN)The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an ad for fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent featuring a model who it said was "unhealthily underweight." The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the black-and-white image of a model in a short, black dress and platform high heels was "irresponsible." The ad appeared in Elle UK magazine. The model's pose and the lighting effect drew attention to her rib cage, which was "visible and appeared prominent," the ruling found. The ad also focused on her legs, adding that "her thighs and knees appeared a similar width, and ... looked very thin," especially the "contrast between the narrowness of her legs and her platform shoes," according to the ruling. The ad is the latest in a long line of controversies surrounding the fashion industry's use of thin models, among them the death from anorexia of French model Isabelle Caro following a shocking ad campaign and bans on ultra-skinny models in Israel and France. The UK agency looked into the ad following a complaint from an Elle UK reader. In response to the ruling, Yves Saint Laurent SAS indicated it didn't agree with the view that the model was unhealthily thin "but did not provide a detailed response," the agency said. Both Elle UK magazine and Yves Saint Laurent declined to comment on the ban when CNN reached out to them. A representative from Beat, a UK charity that supports those affected by eating disorders said: "The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation (is) to grow up with a robust sense of their self-worth." "The ASA ruling is not about whether this person in the picture is healthy, but whether the images of her are being used in a way that can have an irresponsible effect on others, and we are really pleased to see that they are taking action to uphold their responsibility for the social impact of adverts," the rep added. The Advertising Standards Authority said that the ad must not appear again in its current form and called on advertisers to ensure images in their ads were created responsibly. </corpo>

        <titulo>Architect designs giant 3D-printed estate - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-03T11:47:58Z</data>

        <corpo>(CNN)There's already a 3D-printed house being built in the Netherlands. In China, 3D-printed mansions are reportedly on the rise. Now, a 3D printed estate featuring a swimming pool, jacuzzi, car port and 2,400 square foot house could be coming to a sleepy plot of land in upstate New York. The ambitious project is being undertaken by New York City architect Adam Kushner, alongside partners including 3D-printing pioneer Enrico Dini and his D-Shape firm. Kushner told CNN that surveying has already begun with excavation work also set to commence soon. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are penciled in to be completed by December 2015 while construction of the house is expected to continue until the end of 2017, he says. But the project hinges on getting the giant 3D printer, which will be used to produce the digitally designed building blocks of the estate on-site, into the country. The device is currently in Italy after it was originally being built for a project partly funded by the Italian defense agencies. Military clearance is now required before the green light is given to export the printer to the United States, Dini says. The delay in receiving this clearance is part of the reason the project has been held up since it was first announced back in August 2014. "We are now waiting (for) permission to borrow the printer (from the military)," Dini says. "If I had another printer I'd send it there tomorrow, but unfortunately we don't have and must wait."  Whatever the import-export issues, Kushner says he sees the estate project as a test of D-Shape's printer technology and its distinctive method. This practice entails collecting sand, dust and gravel on site and mixing them with a magnesium-based binding agent to produce the 3D-printed building blocks required to piece the estate together. According to literature on the D-Shape website, the material produced by the printer is "similar to marble" in its constitution. This technique is vastly different from other 3D-printing methods, Kushner says, and enables the production of many more "sculptural forms" that simply aren't possible with other systems. If D-Shape can prove its technology works and is efficient for a project of this size, Kushner believes it could lead to all manner of possibilities in architecture and construction. Not only could it be faster and safer than existing construction methods, he says, it could also end up being cheaper, more streamlined and of higher quality. And although the 3D-printed estate is something only the very wealthiest would be able to replicate, Kushner sees D-Shape's construction methods benefiting the less fortunate as well. "This will serve as a way of using our project to ... pave the way for more humanitarian purposes that we see as the highest and best use for our technology," he says. "If we can build a simple pool house, I can print thousands of refugee housings. If I can build a pool, I can print underwater reefs (which he says D-Shape has already done before) to repair bridges, piers and infrastructures."  Integrating progressively more advanced 3D-printing methods into the construction industry has been a topic that has generated many eye-catching headlines in recent years. The process of contour crafting -- where large 3D printers are assembled on a building site (much like what will happen on Kushner's estate) and programmed to construct pre-designed concrete structures and their relevant sub-components -- was put forward by Dr. Behrokh Khoshnevis of the University of Southern California as far back as 2009. Khoshnevis told industry website 3DPrint.com earlier this year that the first printers large enough for his version of contour crafting should become available within the next two years. He added that the method could even be used to build high-rise structures within ten years. Chinese firm WinSun seemed to take inspiration from Khoshnevis' methods when they claimed to have 3D printed a mansion and six-story tower block in the city of Suzhou, eastern China earlier this year. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, DUS Architects continue to piece together a 3D-printed house using its "KamerMaker" machine. Company co-founder Katherine De Wit described the DUS technique as being a potentially valuable tool that could be added to those already used to build homes. Other experts, however are more cautious about the immediate potential of 3D-printing technology in the construction industry. In an interview with CNN in 2014, Dr. Phil Reeves, managing director of UK-based 3D-printing consultancy and research firm Econolyst, described 3D-printing a house on site like that planned by DUS as counter to existing building techniques which are already relatively efficient. Then there are other fast-developing building methods like prefabricated construction which entails manufacturing components in a factory before transporting and rapidly piecing them together on a building site. Chinese firm Broad Sustainable Building claimed to have used this method to piece together a 57-story skyscraper in just 19 days earlier this year. For Kushner, however, the benefits of large-scale 3D-printing are many and will likely increase as the technology becomes more advanced. "This is not superfluous, nor a lazy architects idyll," he says. "I think it's as important as the automobile was in changing the design of cities or how the printing press altered communication." "Why? Because it democratizes construction and architecture and puts it into everyone's hands, just like the camera phone made everyone a photographer. Not everyone is good at it but everyone can become one." Read: Dutch firm build 'world's first 3D-printed house Read: Life inside the densest place on earth </corpo>

        <titulo>Amanpour joins migrant rescue operation - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>Christiane Amanpour and Dominique van Heerden, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Lampedusa, Italy (CNN)The Italian Navy approached the rickety wooden ship with caution, and a wide berth. Go in too quickly, and the people onboard become so excited about their impending rescue that they capsize by all moving to one side. This is how so many of the drowning disasters have happened. As European leaders decide on measures to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the race to save lives on the high seas goes on, as our CNN team witnessed firsthand. We started our day on a helicopter bound for the frigate Virginio Fasan, one of the Italian Navy's most modern warships, currently in international waters facing the Libyan coast. Along with four other Italian naval vessels they patrol an area of sea about the size of the United Kingdom; some 80,000 square miles. It's a huge effort for the 1,000 men and women continuously at sea, because each rescue takes several hours. Barely 30 minutes into our chopper flight journey the pilot tells us they have spotted a boat, possibly full of migrants. And onboard screens beaming imagery of a wooden vessel packed to the gills confirms their suspicions. The blue boat is on course for Lampedusa, they've completed almost half the journey from Libya 85 miles from where we are... now in international waters the smugglers use their cell phones to call the Italian coast guard for help! That's their MO. The warship Sfinge (Sphinx) is closest, and is promptly dispatched to rescue those onboard. Crew on smaller boats hand out the distinctive orange life vests as soon as they arrive. To get closer and at sea level—we fly back to the Fasan and get into the ship's speed boat, and watch as navy teams move people to the warship in small groups. All personnel involved in the operation are dressed head to toe in white biohazard suits, face masks and gloves, in case of infectious disease. We're told that in all the crossings not a single case of Ebola has been brought over. The boat has been checked for hostile intent, and once the navy is satisfied they are all migrants, they begin the slow process of off-loading these people and transferring them by their two small boats to the warship. One by one they bring each person up the stairs—give them a medical, hand out bottles of water, and sit them in rows on the top deck, under the broiling sun. Men are separated from the women and children. One person died, suffocated during the overcrowded boat ride from Libya. Three people had to be medevaced off—but in all this mission saved 289 lives. They are among 900 who were saved on Wednesday in three different wooden boats, because it was sunny and calm. Most of the migrants saved on this day are from Ethiopia, Sudan, and Eritrea in East Africa, escaping a dictatorial regime and military service that they say amounts to slavery. Almost nobody on board speaks English, but one man tells us his story, saying he left his wife and children over a year ago, and hopes his arrival in Europe will mean he can afford a better life for them back home. And even though he knows a lot of people have died trying to make this dangerous crossing, he tells he was not afraid. "We have one chance, to live or to die," he says. We also talk to 25-year-old Juri, who tells us that God answered their prayers in the form of the Italian Navy. "God is good," she says with a big smile on her face, "they save our lives." UPDATE: On Friday, UNHCR reported that 180 of those rescued had been transferred to four facilities in eastern Sicily. The rest, they say, are still at the port and will be transferred soon. The one fatality was a 17-year-old Eritrean man, who reportedly died of asphyxiation in the hull of the boat. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Iraq roils in a maelstrom: ISIS now controls Ramadi, a new prime minister is in charge, Shiite-Sunni bloodshed flows, and a U.S.-led coalition is back, this time executing airstrikes in Iraq. The saga of Iraq is, as an analyst put it, "a rather straightforward but sad story" since the U.S. military left the country at the end of 2011, only to find itself returning in a smaller way. The fall of Ramadi to ISIS this week strikes many as a milestone because the city is the capital of Iraq's biggest province and because U.S. troops heroically fought insurgents there in the mid-2000s. Some politicians feel the U.S. withdrawal of troops was a mistake, though public opinion favored it then. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Too late for that now," said Paul Salem of the nonpartisan Middle East Institute. See Interactive Timeline on ISIS's Rise Iraq's problems are bigger than Ramadi: its second largest city, Mosul, is now ISIS' capital, and Iraq still struggles with self-governance, politically and militarily. Here are events since late 2011 that help explain Iraq's ongoing conflict:  December 31, 2011 After almost 4,500 Americans were killed and more than 30,000 injured since 2003 when the United States invaded Iraq, President Barack Obama orders the withdrawal of all troops. The President welcomes them home. "The war in Iraq will soon belong to history," Obama says. "Your service belongs to the ages. "We are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people," the President also says. The return of U.S. soldiers fulfills Obama's campaign pledge in 2008 to end the war. In Iraq, the day is celebrated as "Iraq Day."  February 2012 Tension grows between Iraq's Shiite and Sunni sects. Their blood feud reaches back decades. The Shiites control the central government under Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi is accused of terrorism by the top judicial committee. The body alleges al-Hashimi's security detail carried out 150 attacks between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi dismisses the accusations as politics, noting the judicial committee is controlled by Shiites, and his party threatens to boycott parliament.  March 2012 Some good news, relatively speaking. Violence kills 112 people, the lowest monthly death toll since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, officials say. It's a good sign for the country's ability to maintain security. Iraq also hosts an Arab League summit, a gathering that signals the political emergence of postwar democratic Iraq. But it doesn't last long: By July, violence reaches a nearly two-year peak, with 325 deaths that month.  June 2012 Prime Minister al-Maliki comes under increasing criticism but he survives the threat of a no-confidence vote by parliament. President Jalal Talabani announces that there is not enough support for the vote. Al-Maliki's opponents accuse him of monopolizing power. Later, Osama al-Nujaifi, speaker of parliament, presses efforts to oust al-Maliki and says the Prime Minister will be asked to appear before the governing body.  September 10, 2012 Al-Hashimi, Iraq's top Sunni politician, is given a death sentence in absentia, and he lashes out at the country's top Shiite leader, Prime Minister al-Maliki. Al-Hashimi denies overseeing death squads. "The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it," al-Hashimi tells reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months earlier. "To my dear people, I say, make sure that al-Maliki and those who stand behind him don't get what he wishes. Because they want sectarian strife," al-Hashimi says. He remains in exile.  December 31, 2012 The anniversary of the U.S. troops' departure is celebrated as "Day of Sovereignty." But the political climate remains divisive. Days before the anniversary, thousands of Sunnis protest in the streets of Anbar province, a region key to trade with Jordan and Syria, and the Sunnis denounced al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie Esawi, a Sunni. Sunnis and ethnic Kurds accuse al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran.  March 2013 Syria, torn by civil war, increasingly loses control of its border with Iraq. Concern looms that Sunni militants on both sides of the border will be capable of challenging governments in both Damascus and Baghdad and control a no-man's land. This foreshadows the rise of ISIS, which began as a splinter group of al Qaeda. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria dreams of creating an Islamic state, or caliphate, across the Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria. The month also marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led coalition invading Iraq and later ousting authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein.  July 2013 Iraq sees the deadliest month in the last five years since sectarian violence peaked in 2006 and 2007: 1,057 Iraqis are killed and 2,326 more are wounded in acts of terrorism and violence. Al Qaeda in Iraq was declared "on the run" before the U.S. pullout, but now it and other Sunni extremist groups grow stronger as the Shiite-led government fails to bring Sunnis into the political fold. Iraq's Sunni population claims that it is targeted by government forces and grows more alienated and disenfranchised. Al Qaeda in Iraq has expanded into Syria under the umbrella of "Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant (Syria)."  January 2014 Questions arise on whether Prime Minister al-Maliki can hold Iraq together against a rising insurgency. ISIS grows. It was known as al Qaeda in Iraq, but now the acronym "ISIS" appears more in news accounts as the militant group seeks to create a single Islamic state in Syria, Iraq and even Lebanon. ISIS continues to exploit a security vacuum across Iraq. It and government troops battle in Ramadi and Falluja -- famous battlegrounds from the days when U.S. forces occupied the country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stresses that America won't send troops. ISIS fighters are "the most dangerous players in the region," Kerry says.  February 2014 Al Qaeda and ISIS divorce, so to speak. Al Qaeda's central leadership says ISIS "is not a branch of the al Qaeda group." ISIS rejects al Qaeda's leadership. Al Qaeda describes ISIS as too brutal. One thing is clear: the jihadists are infighting.  June 2014 ISIS seizes Mosul in northern Iraq and threatens a march on Baghdad. Another northern city, Samarra, is besieged. A strategic border crossing in the western province of Anbar, the largest geographically in Iraq, falls to ISIS fighters. They also take four small towns. The speed of Iraq's deterioration surprises U.S. officials. Obama says he's prepared to send military advisers to Iraq but not in a combat role.  August 2014 Obama authorizes "targeted airstrikes" against ISIS outposts in northern Iraq as the militants advance to Irbil, known as a regional capital for the country's ethnic Kurds. About 130 Marines and special operations forces are sent to northern Iraq to help tens of thousands of the minority Yazidi people trapped in the mountains by ISIS, who vow to kill them. "Very specifically, this is not a combat boots on the ground operation," U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says. ISIS is "a credible alternative to al Qaeda," a U.S. intelligence official tells CNN. ISIS shocks the world by releasing its first beheading video of an American -- the victim is journalist James Foley -- and threatens the life of another American captive if Obama doesn't end military operations in Iraq. Other beheading videos will follow later. Meanwhile, Prime Minister al-Maliki withdraws his candidacy for a third term as pressure mounts abroad and at home for him to step down. Replacing him will be Haider al-Abadi, who, like al-Maliki, is a member of the Islamic Dawa Party, one of the country's biggest Shiite political blocs.  September 2014 Obama announces the United States will launch airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria, too. The United States underestimated ISIS and overestimated the Iraqis' military will to fight, Obama says. U.S. Secretary of State Kerry adds the expanded military campaign will take time to degrade ISIS. "There's definitely a second day and there will be a third and more. This is going to go on," Kerry says. Several other countries will join the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.  February 2015 Obama asks Congress to formally authorize the use of the U.S. military in the war against ISIS, but he doesn't call for ground troops in Iraq or Syria.  April 2015 Iraqi forces, joined by Shiite militiamen, enjoy a victory: They retake the city of Tikrit from ISIS.  May 17, 2015 ISIS scores a victory whose symbolism resonates with Americans: After months of clashes with Iraqi and allied forces, ISIS takes control of the key Iraqi city of Ramadi after government security forces pull out of a military base on the west side. The rise and rise of ISIS Ramadi is 70 miles west of Baghdad. </corpo>

        <titulo>Photographer documents possessions of Chinese families - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-18T11:26:36Z</data>
        <autor>Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)For more than a decade, Chinese photographer Ma Hongjie has asked dozens of families across the country to empty their homes and pose in front of everything they own. His goal is to tell the stories of those who have been bypassed by China's economic boom -- the people living on the bottom rung of society that haven't enjoyed the fruits of the country's transformation. "The possessions are not even wealth. It's just their lives -- showing how the grassroots try to make a living," said Ma, a photo editor at Chinese National Geography magazine. While the mesmerizing images show a variety of landscapes, lifestyles and cultures, what's most striking is their similarity -- the neatly lined up possessions are mostly daily essentials and tools of trade. Their owners appear proud yet humble. Almost all of Ma's subjects are rural families. He has asked richer families living in cities to participate, but they weren't willing to take part in the project, he said. They possess a lot more, and were afraid of the repercussions of showcasing their wealth, Ma explained. "Yet grassroots were fully at ease showing me whatever they have," he said. "They'd first feel wary about my request, but when I showed the samples they thought it was interesting." Although China now is the second largest economy after the United States, it is also home to the second largest number of poor people in the world, according to the World Bank. Almost 100 million people lived below the national poverty line of $1 a day in 2012.  In his book, which is due to be published later in May, Ma gives the back stories of the families he's photographed. The deepest impression the people he profiled has left upon him is their attitude. Powerless, they never demand anything, Ma said. "Are they satisfied? No. But they have no choice but to accept whatever happens to them," he added. "But they try to live with however little they possess." Although humbling, it also frustrated him. "They suffer from silence." Ma recently revisited the first family he profiled. They lived in a rural town in a mountainous area of Hunan province in southeastern China, back in 2003. To his dismay, nothing had changed in the 10 years since his first visit; their shabby house had become even shabbier, he said. Their sons wanted to get married, but the family couldn't afford to build new homes for them. They had hoped tourism would develop in this old town so that the family would be subsidized for moving out—then the sons would be able to marry, he said.  Similar stories unfolded everywhere Ma traveled. The Sun family live on boats on the Yellow River that winds through China's heartland. Sun Guiyou, who has been traversing the rivers and lakes for his entire life, says his biggest dream is to one day have a permanent house built on the land. Although the family say they are better off since he first photographed them in 2006, nothing much has changed and they haven't been able to build a home on solid ground. "The way they make a living doesn't change, they are still fishing," he said. "The grandchildren didn't get a good education, or even dropped out of school. You can see them repeating their grandparent's life in the future."  Ma said he was stunned by the diversity of cultures and lifestyles he came across and that it was harrowing to witness these traditions erode. Only a few of the local artisans and performers he met said their offspring were willing to carry on their crafts. Instead, they go to the cities and become migrant workers. When he visited a village in Hainan province in 2010, people lived in small huts. On his return years later, the huts had been replaced by brick and cement dwellings built by the government. In response, the villagers had built new huts next to the government subsidized housing instead, because they were not built in a way that suited their lifestyle. Ventilating smoke from how they cooked meals became difficult in those houses. "The local government thought living in huts was uncivilized, but they were unique," Ma said. "Why should everything be uniform?" The families he documented also shared a hatred of red tape - they bemoaned interference from the local government. So when the government decided to scrap an ancient tradition of taxing farmers for agricultural produce in 2006, farmers and peasants were thrilled by the news. "They simply want to be left alone -- 'Don't make our life so troublesome, let us farm and let us live,' they told me." Ma said. </corpo>

        <titulo>Texas hunter bags rhino on controversial Namibia hunt - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Northern Namibia (CNN)In January 2014, Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 for a permit to hunt and kill a black rhino in Namibia. He won the permit and became a target himself. The hunt is now complete. A rhino is dead. This is how it happened.  Windhoek, Namibia -- Knowlton arrived quietly in Namibia to hunt the famed black rhino. Nearly 18 months ago, the Texas hunter bid $350,000 to kill a black rhinoceros in the southern African country of Namibia. The permit was issued by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism and auctioned by the Dallas Safari Club. Since then, Knowlton has faced scathing criticism and death threats as the world reacted to the controversial hunt of one of the world's most endangered species. Knowlton has spent the last year and a half preparing and planning the hunt that is being highly scrutinized by animal welfare groups around the world. He agreed to let our CNN crew document the hunt. "At this point, the whole world knows about this hunt and I think it's extremely important that people know it's going down the right way, in the most scientific way that it can possibly happen," Knowlton said after arriving in Africa. Knowlton, 36, from Dallas, wants the world to see that the hunt of such a majestic beast on the African continent is not the work of a bloodthirsty American hunter but a vital component of Namibia's effort to save the animal from extinction. Knowlton's $350,000 will go to fund government anti-poaching efforts across the country. And the killing of an older rhino bull, which no longer contributes to the gene pool but which could harm or kill younger males, is part of the science of conservation, he argues. That's why he says he's doing more to save the black rhino than his critics, and why he wanted us along on this historic hunt. Opponents like the International Fund for Animal Welfare have not been swayed, saying hunting as conservation is a bankrupt notion. "We'll simply never agree with that," fund director Azzedine Downes said. "There's a lot of other things that we can and must do in order to protect these animals." The journey of this hunt will examine the emotional debate raging around the issue of how best to protect endangered species on a continent that is home to some of the most legendary animals on the planet. "I think people have a problem just with the fact that I like to hunt," Knowlton said. "I want to see the black rhino as abundant as it can be. I believe in the survival of the species."  Northern Namibia -- The hunt sets off with a sunrise flight to the region of Namibia where Knowlton will track a black rhino. There's a great deal of concern about news coverage of the hunt in Namibia. We've been told that when our reports are broadcast around the world that Namibian government officials fear poaching syndicates will use the information to identify the location of other black rhinos. For that reason, we have agreed not to report the specific locations of the hunt. According to animal conservationists, there are approximately 5,000 black rhinos in the wild worldwide today, 2,000 of them in Namibia. Hentie van Heerden is a professional hunter hired by the Namibian government to guide Knowlton on the highly scrutinized hunt of the black rhino. Van Heerden, 40, has an international clientele, mostly from Europe, who come to hunt wild game and the exotic animals of Africa. He was born in Namibia and grew up hunting. The thorn-infested terrain in the north of the country does not faze him. He wears sandals even when he hunts the wildest of animals. The bearded van Heerden has the dry sense of humor of a skilled hunter teaching a journalist what to do if we are to stare down a charging rhino. "The aim is to get out of its way without him flattening you," he said. "It's very rare that they come back for seconds and if that is the case, you have to get some more out of its way." Van Heerden says there are a few critics of the black rhino hunt in Namibia, but most people here embrace a culture of hunting. "There will always be activists and that's how they make their money," he said. "They have no clout here in Namibia, because people understand hunting." The hunt is sanctioned and monitored by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It has identified 18 black rhinos across the country that meet the criteria for being hunted and eliminated. The rhino must be an older rhino that is no longer reproducing and is considered a threat to younger, healthier rhinos. Rhinos are intensely territorial and will often kill each other in gruesome fights. Knowlton is targeting one of four black rhinos at the top of the government list, the ones considered "high priority threats to the herd." But identifying these rhinos in the dense brush and in the heat of a dangerous hunt makes Knowlton uneasy, though he will have the help of local trackers and guides. "If it charges at us and we are already sure it's the right one, we are going to kill it," Knowlton said. "If we aren't sure if it's the right one, we are going to try and get out of the way. If we don't feel like we can get out of the way, we got to kill it." That would be the worst-case scenario for Knowlton. For him, the rhino hunt must be carried out flawlessly.  Northern Namibia -- Just after sunrise, Knowlton arrives at a watering hole hidden deep in the Namibian brush to start the hunt. Two government trackers have spotted signs of a rhino heading away from the water. The footprint appears fresh. The weathered wrinkles of the rhino's hide are still visible in the print. The intricate details in the sand suggest the tracks are just a few hours old. The government tracker says, based on the footprints, he can tell this animal is probably one of the black rhinos Knowlton has been permitted to hunt, and that the animal is probably no more than 5 miles away. This is where the hunt begins. The trackers move quickly through the thorny bush and tall grasses. They rarely speak. Quick hand signals are all they need to show the path to follow. Silence is vital when you're tracking a black rhino. The hunting party winds its way through the brush. The rhino's footprints suggests the nearly 3,000 pound (1,360 kilogram) beast is meandering, which tells the hunters it does not feel threatened. As the heat of the day intensifies, rhinos will usually find shady areas to take quick naps. The ranger from the ministry who is observing and leading the trackers says the hunting party is gaining ground on the rhino. But the brush is so dense. Knowlton worries that we could stumble across the rhino at any moment and end up face to face. "I think people think of it as this docile thing," Knowlton said of his prey. "But you are dealing with an extremely athletic animal that can do whatever it wants to you very quickly." The only sounds are the brushes and scrapes of the hunting party cutting through the thorn-infested bushes of this terrain. It seems like every bush has wicked thorns that rip across our skin and clothing. Rhinos have an intense sense of smell and hearing that alerts them to danger from hundreds of yards away. The winds are swirling in the early afternoon hours and the tracker says the rhino can probably sense our presence and is moving away quickly. Knowlton is more concerned with something else. He's been told there are three rhinos known to inhabit the area he's in, but the Namibian government has only authorized the hunting of two of them. Visibility in the brush around us is down to about 15 feet (4.6 meters.) Knowlton is worried that if the rhino charges through the thick brush that he would only have a split second to decide whether to take the shot. It's becoming too risky. We've spent five hours trekking nearly 6 miles through the brush when Knowlton and his hunting partner decide to call it a day. Killing the wrong rhino, Knowlton said, would be a catastrophic mistake. Last year, one of Knowlton's critics suggested the trophy hunting of a black rhino was like shooting a couch in a living room. This criticism annoys Knowlton endlessly. He's quick to bring it up with a heavy dose of sarcasm. "So this is just like hunting a couch? Give me a break," he said. "This isn't easy. It's brutal."  On the road to southern Namibia -- Knowlton decides the hunt in the north is too treacherous. The brush is dense and visibility low. That's a dangerous combination for the hunting party and Knowlton knows that killing the wrong rhino will make him an even bigger target of international outrage. He and his hunting guide decide to drive to southern Namibia to target another dangerous black rhino that lives in a region with better visibility. But on the way we hear that rhino has died, probably of natural causes.  Northern Namibia -- Knowlton returns to the region that makes him the most nervous. And on this morning, the trails are not strong. The trackers have trouble finding prints leading away from the watering holes where the rhinos drink vast amounts of water. It's clear the rhino hunt will not end today.  Northern Namibia -- The morning starts with a startling discovery. Knowlton's professional hunting guide has discovered a camera image showing a rhino at a remote watering hole just before sunrise. The image is stunning. The rhino is more massive than I expected. Its horn is long with a lethal pointed tip. Knowlton spots a large gash in the rhino's ear. It's a crucial identifying mark that tells him instantly this rhino is on the approved government list to be hunted. The hunting party quickly picks up the tracks and disappears into the vicious African bush. The rhino footprints are fresh and light on the sand, telling the trackers the animal is slowly walking, eating grass and taking naps in the shade to avoid the rising sun. Today feels different. There's a sense that just beyond our view we are close to the rhino. The hunting party stops to drink water in the shade of a tree for 20 minutes. When the tracking resumes, Knowlton discovers the spot where the rhino had been resting not moments earlier. You can see the imprint of its wrinkled hide still fresh on the sandy ground. The rhino is close. Knowlton's hands firmly grip his high-powered 500 Nitro Express rifle. Moments later, I see a massive flash of gray leap up over the bushes some 50 feet in front of us. It disappears and you can't tell which direction the rhino is running. It's jarring to see this close how quickly these massive creatures can move. I remember the advice van Heerden, the professional hunting guide, gave me the day before. "You can't outrun the rhino," he said. "If it means to dive into a thorn bush to the left or to the right, we need to get out of its way in a big hurry." Now we can't see the rhino, but we know it's close. Van Heerden tells Knowlton, "He's angry. The next time he will charge." Twenty minutes later as the hunting party moves through the brush, I hear a sound I've not heard before during our trek. The rhino is moving around but it's invisible. It's impossible to grasp how such a beast can move like a ghost in the brush. The hunting party moves single file through a tree line. As the last member of the group emerges, he looks to his left and no more than 40 feet away the rhino is there, staring straight at us. "There it is!" says the last member in the group. It's a breathtaking sight. But this isn't the time to stand and stare. I cut to one side and the rhino starts charging in my direction. "Ed! Get down!" shouts van Heerden. I rush behind Knowlton and his hunting guide. "As soon as you dropped below my gun, I could see the whole animal right behind you," Knowlton would tell me later. I turn around and for a quick flash only see the top half of the rhino in front of us. Then four shots explode through the air. The rhino has been hit at least three times. The hunting party then makes the final push to find the rhino. I've lost track of time. This last push might have taken 30 minutes, it might have taken an hour. It was an incredibly emotional experience. A tracker climbs into a tree and spots the rhino in an open field about 100 yards away. Knowlton gets into position and fires the final shots. The black rhino is dead. Knowlton walks up from behind the rhino and when he's certain it's over, he kneels next to it. "Any time you take an animal's life it's an emotional thing," Knowlton said. The Namibian government official assures Knowlton it is the rhino on the approved hunting list. The trackers smile with relief and shake hands. I ask Knowlton if he still feels that killing this black rhino was the right thing to do and that it will benefit the future of this endangered species. "I felt like from day one it was something benefiting the black rhino," Knowlton reflected just moments after the hunt ended. "Being on this hunt, with the amount of criticism it brought and the amount of praise it brought from both sides, I don't think it could have brought more awareness to the black rhino."

        <titulo>Traitors no more? North Korean defectors 'forgiven' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN)Kkot-jebi -- literally "flower swallows" -- sounds poetic, but the reality is much harsher. The North Korean term refers to homeless children, fending for themselves without the support of family or state. The word traces it roots back to the aftermath of the Korean War, an imaginative pronunciation of the Russian word "kochevyi," meaning "wandering," and referring to those displaced by the 1950-53 conflict. During the 1990s, North Korea was hit by several years of famine as disastrous harvests laid waste to the land, killing hundreds of thousands, according to conservative estimates. The country's social safety net was reduced to tatters. Families fell apart. And flower swallows re-emerged in large numbers. Although conditions today are much better, North Korea remains desperately poor. Food is in short supply for a large portion of the population -- and kkot-jebi are still very much in existence.  North Korea is one of the most secretive societies in the world. When a CNN team recently visited, our entire schedule was arranged by our official government hosts. Our "minders" accompanied us on every shoot. We had put in certain requests, but we never knew more than a few hours in advance what the next item on our itinerary would be. When we were told to go to a meeting room at our hotel one afternoon, we had no idea who was going to be behind the doors, just something to do with the reality of defectors. When we walked through the doors and saw eight young people sitting on one side of a huge round conference table, we immediately knew who we were to meet.  In early summer 2013, the world's media cried foul over the repatriation of a group of nine North Korea children, then aged between 14 and 19, from Laos. They had been picked up by border security as they were being smuggled from China into Laos by South Korean missionaries, in the hope of getting them resettled in South Korea. READ: Agonizingly close to freedom Pyongyang is not shy about its hatred of defectors. It refers to them in official media as "human scum" and accuses them of criminal acts, lying about their own country for fame and money and abandoning their own families. The decision to return the children was widely condemned. Dire predictions were made about their fate: The children were being sent back to prison; they would face a lifetime of retribution and could even be executed. But here in this room, nearly two years after their return, these former kkot-jebi appear transformed. Four young men dressed in the blue blazers of university students and two boys and two girls in secondary school uniforms, all sat waiting to answer our questions. The ninth member of the group was in a university further away from Pyongyang and could not be brought in at short notice.  They were all children between the ages of 12 and 17 when they crossed into China, separately or in small groups. They only met after they arrived at the missionaries' house. We asked why they left -- it was an uncomfortable opening question. "We were young," said 17-year-old Ri Gwang Hyok. "We just went to China for fun." Pressed for more detail, Mun Chol, 21, admitted: "Frankly, we had some family difficulties. We had been through a period in our history we call 'the arduous march (the years of famine).' We were not living well. I was young and naive. We were living by the Amnok river, which is at the border. I meant to return home. I was curious." We then asked how many of them had experienced hunger before they left. Four of the eight raised their hands. "It was winter. We had preserved food during autumn. But it wasn't enough. Our family was too large," explained Pak Kwang Hyok, 19. Once in China, the children were brought to a house in the border town of Dandong, looked after by a South Korean missionary CNN has called M.J. in previous reports, along with his wife. There, according to M.J., the starving children were transformed. According to the youngsters now, the picture was not so rosy. They said they were kept in the house for a year and a half. "The missionary lectured us about freedom," recalled Mun Chol. "But we weren't given any freedom. He forced us to study God and memorize religious books. "Of course, the food was good," he added, "but that was our only pleasure. When you have food things seem OK, but a kid needs more than that." Following our encounter with the students, CNN contacted M.J., who asked about their well-being. He says he misses them. While hesitant to say much out of fear for their safety, he insists the students needed his help after fleeing North Korea.  China is a historical ally of North Korea, and North Koreans found illegally in the country face deportation if caught. After a year and a half, the missionary decided to move the children to a third country. He chose Laos, on China's southwestern border, from where he hoped he could get them to South Korea. After a harrowing night trek for four hours through the hilly border region, the party were picked up by Laotian police and detained. When they were told they would be sent back to North Korea they were terrified. "The missionary said we would be killed if we went back," said Mun Chol. "He told us our families had been killed because we had left our homes."  But instead of being punished, they tell us they received special treatment, extra tuition to make up for three years of missed schooling, and are now studying in the best educational establishments in the capital. "I was scared," admitted Pak Gwang Hyok. "I had left my home with a guilty conscience and spent time abroad. We had betrayed our country. I thought we would be punished. But now we are studying in the best universities in Pyongyang. Our fears were pretty foolish." Soon after their return, the children appeared on North Korean television to denounce their enticement to defect by South Koreans. Now , more than a year later, they are again on display. They have become poster children for the "benevolence and forgiveness" of the North Korean authorities. There is a huge difference between their lives when they left for China and now. "I feel like a pauper who has become a prince," said Ri Gwang Hyok. But their families have not joined them in Pyongyang, the showcase capital. They remain in the poor border areas and their lives have not changed. When he thinks about what might have happened if he had made it to South Korea, Mun Chol said, "If I had made it, I could have become a traitor -- a bad guy who deserts his family. "I could have gone down in history as one of the 'scum of the earth.'" READ: North Korean: I felt like a slave in Kuwait </corpo>
