        <corpo>Bradford, England (CNN)The husbands of British sisters who have gone missing with their children pleaded tearfully Tuesday for their families to come home amid fears they have headed to Syria, which is ravaged by terrorism and war. "You know, Mariya, I love you. I don't know what to say," said Akhtar Iqbal, the husband of Sugra Dawood, addressing his young daughter at a televised press conference in Britain. "I'm shaking and I miss you. It's been too many days. I don't where you are. Please come back home." Then he teared up as he addressed his whole family, "I miss you, I love you, all of you. I love you a lot. I can't live without you. Please, please call me. " Three sisters and their nine children from northern England disappeared while on a trip to the Middle East. The husbands of two of the sisters appealed for help in tracking the family down amid concerns the sisters could be trying to join a brother in Syria. "Please contact me," Mohammad Shoaib begged his wife, Khadija Dawood, at the press conference. "I am not angry. ... They are young kids, 7 and 5. And you know I love you so much." The husband of the third sister did not appear, as he is not in the UK. Balaal Khan, a lawyer acting for the Dawood family, said the three missing women and their children, ages 3 to 15, had traveled to Saudi Arabia on an Islamic pilgrimage on May 28. But instead of returning home to the city of Bradford, in northern England, as expected Thursday, they disappeared. They have not been in touch since June 9, and their cell phones have not been active, either. Nor have their social media profiles been updated in the past week, the statement said. The sisters have been named as Khadija Dawood, Sugra Dawood and Zohra Dawood, all in their 30s. Khadija Dawood's two children are Maryam Siddiqui, 7, and Muhammad Haseeb, 5; Sugra Dawood's five children are Junaid Ahmed Iqbal, Ibrahim Iqbal, Zaynab Iqbal, Mariya Iqbal and Ismaeel Iqbal, ages 15 to 3; and Zohra Dawood's two children are Haafiyah Binte Zubair, 8, and Nurah Binte Zubair, 5. Khan, the lawyer, said all 12 boarded a flight from Medina, Saudi Arabia, to Istanbul on June 9. Early reports that two of the children failed to board the plane were wrong, he said. The lawyer told journalists that there were no family problems and the husbands had no clue their wives were about to disappear. The families practice a moderate version of Islam, and there had been no indications of radicalization, he said. He said that a trip to Syria was only one possible theory for the family's disappearance. But he mentioned, as well, that there were concerns about how the women had been able to buy tickets from Saudi Arabia to Turkey.  The brother of the three missing women is already in Syria, Naz Shah, a member of Parliament from the Bradford area, told CNN. And that is why the family is so concerned about the whereabouts of the missing women and their children, she said. Shah added that she has "never heard of anything remotely like this in Bradford before." Turkey has become a popular transit route for people seeking to reach Syria, where ISIS and other opposition groups have been battling the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Another local Bradford member of Parliament, Imran Hussain, has asked Britain's Foreign Office to help find the family. The Foreign Office said: "We are in contact with West Yorkshire police and Turkish authorities and are ready to provide consular assistance."  The Dawood family reported the women and children's disappearance to police after they failed to return as expected. Officers are investigating their whereabouts and are "working extensively with authorities overseas to try and locate them," a statement from West Yorkshire police said. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said: "We are extremely concerned for the safety of the family and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. "Our priority is for their safe return; their families are gravely worried about them and want them home. One of our primary concerns is the safety and welfare of the young children." News of the Dawoods' disappearance came shortly after family members of a teenage boy from West Yorkshire said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS released a photo showing the 17-year-old in front of an ISIS black flag. There are fears the boy, Talha Asmal from Dewsbury, may have been involved in ISIS suicide attacks near the Iraqi city of Baiji. Other teens have also been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left the country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport. CNN's Nic Robertson and Bharati Naik reported from Bradford, while Laura Smith-Spark and CNN's Don Melvin wrote from London. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)An apartment balcony collapsed during a birthday party attended by Irish students in the California city of Berkeley early Tuesday, killing six of the 13 people who fell from the fourth-floor structure, officials said. Three men and three women in their early 20s died following the collapse, officials told reporters. Five of the victims were from Ireland and one was from California, said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff's Department. Those Irish citizens who fell from the balcony at the Library Gardens Apartments were students with short-term work visas, gathered in an apartment to celebrate someone's 21st birthday, Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said earlier. At an afternoon news conference, Nelson released their names: Olivia Burke, 21; Eimear Walsh, 21; Eoghan Culligan, 21; Niccolai Schuster, 21; and Lorcan Miller, 21. Ashley Donohoe, 22, from Rohnert Park, California, was also killed. Besides those who died, at least seven were taken to hospitals with serious injuries after the balcony gave way at about 12:40 a.m., Berkeley police Officer Byron White told CNN. Three victims went to Highland Hospital in Oakland, but officials there said it doesn't have permission to release the conditions of the two women and a man. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the balcony to collapse, Berkeley police spokeswoman Jennifer Coats said. The balcony appeared to have torn away from the rest of the building. Hours after the collapse, the fourth-floor railing -- its base gone -- was resting upside down on the railing of the balcony below, video from CNN affiliate KGO showed. Among the debris on the ground: Smashed pieces of the balcony's concrete floor, a plastic cup and a shoe. The students were among hundreds of Irish young adults who are working in Berkeley on J-1 visas for the summer, Mark Neville told CNN affiliate KGO. Neville, one of the visa holders, said he is staying in the apartment complex, but that he wasn't at the party and didn't know those who were there. He said he was sleeping in a first-floor unit when he "heard a loud bang." "I went out to get a friend, and I just saw the place (outside) was covered in rubble," Neville told KGO. "Bodies had been taken away in ambulances. It was tough to see." At least one person phoned 911 about the birthday to report a noise complaint, but officers didn't go to the building because there were shootings in the area that took priority, Police Chief Michael Meehan said. When 911 calls poured in after the collapse, officers were on scene in 2 minutes, he said. Philip Grant, Ireland's consul general to the Western United States said the first flights carrying relatives of the victims will arrive Tuesday night. Government officials in both Ireland and the United States reacted with sorrow. "We mourn the tragic loss of young lives in California this morning," Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny posted on Twitter on Tuesday. The U.S. ambassador to Ireland, Kevin O'Malley, released a statement offering his sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who died. Flanagan offered his condolences to the victims' relatives in a statement released by his office. He said his department would provide consular assistance to the Irish citizens involved. Irish President Michael Higgins expressed "greatest sadness," saying he learned of the incident while on an official visit to Italy. "My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of all those involved," Higgins said. The apartment is about three blocks from the University of California-Berkeley. The school didn't immediately know if any of the students were affiliated with it, university representative Roqua Montez said. Other balconies at the complex have been "red tagged" and the building owner has been ordered to inspect them, officials said. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Sam Stringer, Steve Almasy, Laura Smith-Spark and Sheena Jones contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Is Hong Kong's fight for democracy in its final round? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-16T09:40:42Z</data>
        <autor>Wilfred Chan, CNN, and Elaine Yu, for CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Could Hong Kong's fight for democracy be entering its final round? Six months after the end of the massive "Occupy" protests that paralyzed the city's streets last fall, another pivotal confrontation is brewing in the former British colony. It comes down to a Beijing-backed bill that could decide Hong Kong's future. If it passes, the city will be able to vote for its own leaders -- as long as China approves the candidates. If it doesn't pass, Hong Kongers may never be able to vote for their leaders at all. It's a surprisingly complex story of a city struggling to transition from colonial to Chinese rule. How did we get here, and what's coming next? Our guide will get you up to speed.  Hong Kong is a small piece of land colonized by the British in 1841 and returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The majority of its 7 million people speak Cantonese, whereas most people in China speak Mandarin. Officially, Hong Kong is a Chinese "special administrative region", under a principle called "One Country, Two Systems." In practice, that means Hong Kong is a Chinese territory, but maintains its own currency, government, and laws: Websites like Facebook and Twitter aren't blocked here, residents can protest and criticize the government, and the press is not censored by law. This special status is set to expire in the year 2047.  It's about a deal that some say hasn't been fulfilled. When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Read more: What is 'One Country, Two Systems'? Many Hong Kongers strongly believe the city is entitled to free and open elections -- an interpretation that local authorities, backed by Beijing, staunchly oppose. Years of negotiations have failed to yield an agreement. The conflict peaked dramatically last fall as pro-democracy Hong Kongers staged massive street occupations paralyzing key parts of the city in a bid to pressure authorities to make concessions. That movement, known as "Occupy Hong Kong" or the "Umbrella Movement," enjoyed popular support among Hong Kong's youth and drew headlines around the world. No matter: The government refused to budge, condemning the protests and eventually clearing the sites after 79 days. Watch more: What's next for Hong Kong's 'Generation Occupy'?  Chinese authorities have proposed what they say is a fair and final offer: Hong Kongers may vote for their next leader, as long as the candidates are narrowed down and approved by the Chinese government. A rolling poll conducted by local universities show that views on the proposal are split down the middle -- with nearly as many supporting as opposing. This week, Hong Kong's legislature will vote on the proposal: It needs two-thirds of the chamber's support to become law. But just over one-third of the chamber is controlled by pro-democracy politicians, and they've sworn to veto the bill. It doesn't seem likely that the Chinese government's proposal will pass.  If Beijing's plan gets vetoed, the existing system for electing the city's leader will remain. That is, he or she will be chosen by a small committee that's stacked with Beijing loyalists. Here's the ominous part for the city's pro-democracy activists: Central authorities have warned this may be Hong Kong's last chance to have "democracy." If this proposal gets shot down, then there won't be a new proposal -- possibly ever, they say. However, the activists aren't buying it. They're determined to fight for "real universal suffrage" -- an election in which anyone can run and anyone can vote. They haven't given a clear explanation of how they plan to achieve this. But if the past is any indication, they'll continue to try a mix of negotiation, campaigning, and civil disobedience -- again, and again, and again.  The increasingly intense struggle for democracy has created a new era in Hong Kong's political climate. A generational gap has opened up between young people, who tend to support democratic reforms, and the older generation, who are comparatively more sympathetic to the establishment. Meanwhile, the share of Hong Kongers who identify as Chinese has dropped. Some ardently anti-mainland activists -- known as "localists" -- have grown more vocal since last fall's Occupy movement. A radical minority of them go as far as to advocate for an independent Hong Kong. Localists found themselves under scrutiny Monday after police arrested 10 people with suspected ties to "local radical groups" in an alleged bomb plot -- though pro-democracy activists have questioned the validity of the accusations. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are concerned about skyrocketing rents, increasing inequality, and diminishing press freedom. However, residents are divided over how much of these issues can be blamed on China's influence. That leads to the big question of what happens after 2047, when Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status expires. Will Hong Kong be allowed to retain control over its own affairs? Will it maintain its local character? Or will it become indistinguishable from other Chinese cities? Pro-democracy Hong Kongers are deeply skeptical that the Chinese Communist Party will loosen its grip. Rather, China's authoritarian influence over the city only seems to grow -- from their perspective, the days in which Hong Kong can enjoy its unique rights and freedoms are numbered. </corpo>

        <titulo>Everest moved by Nepal quake, but still same height - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, was moved 3 centimeters (about 1.2 inches) southwest by the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that devastated Nepal in April, Chinese authorities say. But the April 25 quake, which left more than 8,000 people dead, did not affect the height of the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, according to the report by China's National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation. Chinese state media reported the administration had set a satellite monitoring system on the peak in 2005 to observe the movement of the mountain. In the decade since, Everest had been moving northeast at a speed of 4 centimeters a year, and had grown by 0.3 centimeters annually, state media reported. The April earthquake reversed the direction of the mountain, shifting it to roughly where it would have been nine months earlier. Nepal reopens 7 historic sites after quakes It triggered a number of avalanches on and around the mountain -- which is at the border of Nepal and China -- claiming the lives of many climbers. The deaths led mountaineering companies to call off their climbs for the rest of the season. Heroes' dreams 'scattered' by quake New data showed a second deadly quake in Nepal, which struck on May 12 with a magnitude of 7.5, did not move the mountain, state media reported. Previous analyses by seismologists have said that the mountain probably shifted by as much as meters in the quake, but the height was probably unchanged.

        <titulo>Why Singapore is putting its oil back into the ground - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-16T16:07:41Z</data>
        <autor>Meera Senthilingam and Andrew Stevens, for CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)They're found 150 meters below the ground, taller than a nine-storey building and, once complete, will store 9 million barrels of oil. The Jurong rock caverns in Singapore are defying the challenge of limited land space by creating a deep underground storage facility for the city-state's oil reserves. This is the first project of its kind in South-East Asia, but it has been tried before to great success elsewhere in the world. "In Norway they use it for water treatment plans, in South Korea and Japan they use it for oil storage," says David Tan, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Technical &amp; Professional Services Group at JTC Corporation who are handling the industrial development in Singapore. After eight years in development, the first cavern opened in 2014, with four more in the pipeline. Once complete, the Jurong caverns will consist of an underground network of tunnels storing almost 1.5 million cubic centimeters of liquid hydrocarbons, such as crude oil.  The $700 million dollar venture -- just for phase one -- aims to help Singapore's petrochemical industry prosper by clearing 60 hectares of land above ground for further industrial use. "The 60 hectares of land can be used for about 6 petrochemical plants," says Tan. The petrochemical sector plays a key role in Singapore's $300 billion economy. But as the country has no natural resources to speak of, this income is not generated through oil itself, but through its processing and refinement. According to Singapore's Economic Development Board, the country hosts one of the world's top three export refining centers. The expansion provided by the Jurong rock caverns will make Singapore one of the largest chemical and energy hubs in Asia, helping to reach the nation's goal to double it's petrochemical production by 2030.  The ambitious caverns in Jurong bring with them a range of challenges that engineers need to control, the biggest one being the ingress of water. Water inside the walls of the cavern is inevitable -- and necessary --and prevents the stored oil from leeching out into the rock. But it's a fine balance between too much and not enough. "If too much water comes in, we have to grout the rock," says Tan whose organization strictly monitors the water coming in at all times.  "Singapore is small, so any land is important," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore, where he worked on the planning behind the caverns. "Free land is a driving force," he says. But this is not the first time the country has gone underground. Aside from shopping malls and metro stations, the city-state's first deep underground facility was an underground ammunition facility by Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency -- opened in 2001. "We have good rock geologists in Singapore who can build caverns," says Zhao. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground." Zhao envisions a future where power stations, electrical stations, waste facilities, water treatment plants, warehouses, and data centres could be moved underground.  The Jurong rock caverns have already secured their first customer to ensure the underground space is used as intended. With four more on the way, the mindset behind Singapore's infrastructure is changing. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao, referring to factors such as temperature, humidity and vibration. Zhao believes more facilities can comfortably go underground. "We need to convince the public [that] underground space is nice and comfortable," he says. Changes in perception may be needed as JTC are now looking into heading downwards for spaces housing people -- rather than oil -- in the form of an underground science city. The facility could become a working environment for more than 4000 researchers. "[It's a] better environment for laboratories," says Zhao. Zhao further envisions going even deeper, to enable underground spaces with multiple levels. "We've looked at multi-layers already," he says. But he notes the need for extensive planning -- a strength of Singapore. "Planning is important...because underground spaces you can't remove afterwards," says Zhao. But as these visions are developed, their potential to become a reality will depend on the success of facilities such as the Jurong Caverns -- considered by Tan as a prototype for underground developments in Singapore. "A project like this will give us more confidence to carry out the next project underground," says Tan. </corpo>

        <titulo>Al-Wuhayshi's death deprives al Qaeda of a heavyweight - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-16T14:12:53Z</data>
        <autor>Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Nasir al-Wuhayshi didn't fit the stereotype of a terrorist leader: He was slight, quiet and had an impish sense of humor, according to one of the few Westerners to have met him. But he also had an understated charisma and inspired awe and deep loyalty among al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. Even though he was only in his late 30s, al-Wuhayshi had more than 20 years of experience fighting jihad and had been close to Osama bin Laden. To many observers, his death is the most significant individual blow to al Qaeda since the killing of militant preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (also in Yemen) four years ago. Morten Storm, a Danish informant for Western intelligence who got access to al-Wuhayshi early in 2012, describes him as "one of the last al Qaeda heavyweights, a fighter's fighter." Al-Wuhayshi had fashioned al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, into the only affiliate capable of both taking territory on its home turf and planning sophisticated attacks overseas. The "underpants" bomb designed to bring down a U.S. airliner over Detroit, the plot to blow up planes with printer bombs (which very nearly succeeded), a complex attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, the Paris attack on Charlie Hebdo this year: They and many other conspiracies were hatched by AQAP from its redoubt in Yemen's mountainous southeast. To his admirers, al-Wuhayshi also seemed untouchable. Once bin Laden's personal secretary in Afghanistan, he returned to Yemen and was jailed -- only to escape in a massive breakout of al Qaeda prisoners in 2006. Under his leadership, al Qaeda in Yemen soon became al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and attracted Saudi recruits -- some of them former detainees at Guantanamo Bay. There were rumors that al-Wuhayshi was killed in a U.S. missile strike in December 2009, but he soon resurfaced. He was also seen as the brains behind an ambitious plan to attack U.S. diplomatic missions in 2013 -- one that led to the temporary closure of some 20 U.S. embassies. Al-Wuhayshi contributed to this aura with a brazenly open appearance in front of dozens of jihadists in a video released last year. Apparently oblivious to the danger of a missile strike, he tells the group: "We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!" Despite opportunities at home, AQAP was still very much focused on distant enemies. The United States recognized al-Wuhayshi's significance in declaring him a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist" in 2010, offering a reward of $10 million for information on his whereabouts.  At a time when al Qaeda is being challenged across the Middle East by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, al-Wuhayshi was a totemic figure as leader of the group's most effective and resilient affiliate. ISIS may have become the destination of choice for a new generation of militants, but al-Wuhayshi rejected it unequivocally, swearing a personal oath, or bayat, of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and being appointed the group's second in command globally. In statements late last year, AQAP criticized ISIS for distributing videos of beheadings. And one of its leading ideologues, Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, complained that "our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate (and) they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries where they have no governance," Yemen no doubt included. Even so, one very influential Yemeni cleric has been calling on AQAP to pledge its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And ISIS has continued to establish its presence in Yemen undaunted, with massive suicide bombings of Houthi gatherings in the capital last year and further attacks against Houthi forces since. Its numbers may be in the dozens there, compared with AQAP's in the many hundreds -- according to Yemeni officials -- but it has made its mark.  If al-Zawahiri is the figurehead, a distant chairman of the board, al-Wuhayshi was the dynamic chief executive officer. Not that his death will lead to AQAP's liquidation. Among al Qaeda groups -- and despite successful drone attacks against several of its leading figures -- AQAP has considerable stamina. Even so, al-Wuhayshi's demise deprives the group of the leading light in a tight nucleus that has run the organization since its inception, a cohort that according to a study of AQAP by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point "avoided the strategic mistakes that commonly defeat jihadists elsewhere, keeping AQAP relevant in a highly competitive domestic and international environment." One of the few left in that cohort is now al-Wuhayshi's successor: military commander Qasim al-Raymi, considered the operational brains of the franchise. He has probably been involved in every major decision of the last decade, but is only 37. Like al-Wuhayshi, he was also designated by the U.S. in 2010, with a reward of $5 million attached. Al-Raymi comes from an area near Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. He escaped jail with al-Wuhayshi nine years ago and was planning sabotage attacks against oil installations within months. Some Saudi officials see him as more dangerous than al-Wuhayshi in terms of his ability to plan attacks. He is thought to have conceived the plan to assassinate then-head of Saudi intelligence Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, in 2009. Al Qaeda's chief bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, engineered the device, which was inserted into his brother's rectum but failed to kill bin Nayef. Al-Raymi is important for another reason: He is Yemeni, in a group that includes Saudis and other foreigners. "Removing this top tier of Yemenis while leaving the group's foreign leaders in place would be a catastrophic loss for the group, in effect stripping it of the local credibility and strategic guidance essential to endure in Yemen," concludes the Combating Terrorism Center. Most counterterrorism analysts expect al-Raymi to keep AQAP in the al Qaeda fold, but whether he will have the ability to dent ISIS' budding appeal in Yemen is an open question. He does not have links to "AQ Central" as deep as al-Wuhayshi's, but he was also in al Qaeda's Afghan camps as a teenager in the 1990s. Al-Raymi -- like his predecessor -- sees the war in Yemen as part of "America's broader war against Islam, one in which the United States used Muslim forces to advance its objectives in Iraq, Pakistan and Palestine," according to the Combating Terrorism Center report. He has been excoriating about the drone campaign's effect on Yemen's civilian population. One tidbit on al-Raymi: He may have a blond Croatian wife. In 2009, Morten Storm, an informant for Western intelligence, found and introduced by video a young woman called Irena Horak to al-Awlaki. The cleric was then living in a remote area of Marib province and apparently was desperate for a Western wife. Horak renamed herself Aminah, flew to Yemen and married him. When al-Awlaki was killed, Western intelligence officials told Storm that Aminah may have become al-Raymi's wife. There was even a plan to track down al-Raymi by sending a bugged makeup box to Aminah.  AQAP's fortunes will in great part depend on whether Yemen as a state falls into the abyss or is somehow patched back together thanks to international mediation. The group has flourished since the Houthi takeover of the capital and other parts of central Yemen. As a Shia sect, the Houthis inspire loathing among militant Sunnis, a useful recruiting tool for AQAP. For a while in 2013 and 2014, AQAP was forced onto its back foot as a reorganized Yemeni military, supported by U.S. intelligence and drone warfare, went on the offensive. But the chaos of the last nine months has allowed al Qaeda to re-establish itself in provinces like Shabwa and Hadramaut in the south. It is now one of several actors -- the Houthis, loyalists to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, southern secessionists, the Saudis -- in a complex battlefield of shifting alliances. AQAP has enjoyed the ungoverned space provided by Yemen's implosion, essentially taking over towns like the port of Mukalla in the south while retaining hideouts used by bomb-maker al-Asiri and his apprentices. It has benefited from another mass prison break and the withdrawal of U.S. Special Forces from a base in eastern Yemen. But al-Wuhayshi's death -- along with drone strikes against several other AQAP figures in recent months -- shows that the U.S. retains reach and intelligence in Yemen. And to some analysts, al-Raymi and al-Asiri are the last surviving "big" players in AQAP. So al-Raymi inherits a mantle where risk and opportunity are in almost equal measure. But he certainly knows the territory. Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank are authors of "Agent Storm: My Life inside al Qaeda and the CIA."</corpo>

        <data>2015-06-16T20:17:43Z</data>
        <autor>Eve Parish, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Kurdish fighters claimed Tuesday to have taken the strategic Syrian town of Tal Abyad from ISIS. The town is close to the border with Turkey, about 310 miles (500 kilometers) northeast of Damascus, and lies on a main road to Raqqa, the city ISIS considers to be its capital. Fighting between the Kurdish forces and ISIS went on until dawn Tuesday, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the Kurds had taken "full control" of the town. The Observatory said at least 40 members of the terrorist group were killed as they tried to run into another town in the area. The town's loss will probably cut off an important ISIS supply route. The strategic advance comes a day after the Kurdish YPG, or People's Protection Units, captured the Syrian side of a Turkish border crossing at Akcakale. ISIS -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a terrorist group whose members are predominately Sunni -- is trying to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. It has become known for beheading captives and posting videos of the killings online. Kurdish fighters have already taken about 50 towns and villages from ISIS, Miami Herald columnist Frida Ghitis, quoting the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, wrote Monday in an opinion piece for CNN. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali in Baghdad contributed to this report. CNN's Larry Register and Khushbu Shah also contributed.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)A 10-year-old who lost consciousness on a Six Flags roller coaster in Southern California has died. Jasmine Martinez was airlifted to the hospital Friday when she was found unconscious but still breathing after riding the Revolution roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. She was pronounced dead on Saturday. On Tuesday the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said Martinez died from natural causes and not from an accident on the ride. 2013: Texas roller coaster reopens after woman's death The ride, which opened in 1976 and is billed by Six Flags as "one of the most famous and iconic looping roller coasters in the world," was temporarily closed pending a review of the incident, but reopened Monday night, amusement park officials said. "There is no evidence to suggest that this was in any way ride related," Six Flags Magic Mountain said in a statement expressing condolences to the girl's family. "We do not know if there was a pre-existing condition." More than 45 million people have safely ridden the ride since it opened, Six Flags said. 2014: Six Flags roller coaster car derails in California, 4 injured CNN's Stella Chan, Cheri Mossburg and Tony Marco contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>Burj Mughayzil, Egypt (CNN)On a sandy beach in one of the many inlets dotting Egypt's Mediterranean coastline two men are standing off to one side watching us interview families whose children have been trafficked into Europe. Eventually the taller of them begins to jump in. He starts shouting and explaining why he works on the smuggler boats carrying the human cargo into Europe. "What does the government do for us? We're fishermen but there's nothing to catch." The village, Burj Mughayzil, is essentially a smugglers' village. By their own count 2,000 young men and boys have disappeared. Some as young as 11 and 12, they are lured by the European dream -- but so many of them either end up in Italian jails accused of crewing the smuggling ships or killed in the crossing. We were hoping somewhere on the beach to find a crewman on a smuggling ship, someone who had made the journey and returned. We found two; the tall man and his slimmer friend, who told us they were a ship's mate and a captain. When I asked if they'd talk on camera they agreed. To our surprise they both asked to show their faces and to give their names. CNN has retraced the route traveled by the children from small villages on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, across the sea to Sicily by boat, then making their way to the Italian capital, Rome, where they fall victim to drug and prostitution rings. Thousands of children are risking their lives, falling prey to traffickers, for the dream of a better future for them and their families. Captain Mahmoud and Mohammed told us: "We work the ships. Me and a crew of 15 people. If the [Egyptian] government was helping us in any way we wouldn't be crossing in any way." The trips can take up to nine days on the open seas. The Egyptian Government says it has increased its vigilance along the coastline but still the smugglers are finding ways out. Sometimes he says, 20 boys are crammed on a tiny fishing boat fitted with an onboard motor, so they can be brought out to sea where he and his crew wait on a bigger boat which holds up to 600 people. 'It's risky for the boat and for everyone on it. We could be sentenced to 25 years or be executed if anything happens, God forbid, to anyone on board if it becomes a death trip." He also risks years in an Italian jail on the other side and a 15,000 euro ($17,000) fine for every single person on board. The fine can stretch into the millions, Italian authorities say. It's a risk he knowingly takes. Though, the captain says, leaving him and his men "to rot in jail," is not the solution. "There are big fish and there are small fish. The small fish are the ones who are in Italian jails. The big fish live freely here in Egypt, freely in Italy." Many of the parents claim it is the children themselves who want to go -- but teens we spoke to in Italy say their families expect them to work once they get to Europe and to send money home. Others admit Europe is seen as a way of earning the family much-needed cash but they say they didn't know about the trafficker gangs behind the smuggling routes. Yet others say they were deceived by the smugglers who make empty promises of opportunity across the Med. Authorities in both countries are clear, they say the parents are guilty -- at the very least -- of abandoning their children. The smugglers, Captain Mahmoud says, are very brazen. "We leave here at dusk, dawn, whenever. It doesn't matter if you know you are risking jail anyway. We'll have been paid -- us and the crew - 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,300) each. That feeds a crewman's family and kids for a month. Then after that, who knows? Risk it again or die of hunger." Egyptian minors have been flooding into Italy by the thousands according to the Italian Ministry of Labor, taking advantage of Italian laws that grant state protection to those under 18 who arrive in Italy unaccompanied. It's not just the passengers that are underage though; his crew often is as well. Captain Mahmoud says they are pressured by their families. "People here in this village, they're selling their kids. They think, 'we're 10 [people] and we can't find enough to eat. When we're nine, we can eat a little better. If we're eight, we can eat even better still. If two get locked up? Better than we all die together.' All the people in Italian jails? They're the victims of the parents here who can't afford to eat." I asked if they felt a responsibility for the people making the crossing, for those who have died. "How can we not?" he said. "If anything happens to them, it happens to us. If the ship sinks we drown together." His tall friend, Mohammed, talks over him, "How can we not be sad? These are our cousins, our brothers. I still see their faces." At the end of the interview Captain Mahmoud asks again if we're going to broadcast this, if his government will see this. I tell him, yes, we will. Good, he says. Let them hear the truth.

        <corpo>Sicily, Italy (CNN)The 13-year-old boy looks off into the distance. He is slight of build with pale, almost yellowy eyes. When you see him you feel as if he has seen far too much already. He is carrying a burden far too heavy for his age -- but despite his ordeal so far, smuggled across continents from Africa to Europe, and now living in a care home, his future could be far worse depending which route he takes next. A CNN investigation spent months retracing the smuggling route from Egypt to Italy. Speaking to social workers and authorities, children and parents, there is evidence that many of the children were smuggled into Italy by the same criminal networks, who once they are in country, use them for illegal activities. The Egyptian government agency charged with advising lawmakers on child protection matters told CNN that they believe in some cases the parents are guilty of trafficking, paying for their own vulnerable children to be smuggled so far from home in the hope of securing the family's future. We were interviewing this Egyptian boy and his friends in the picturesque piazza of a small Sicilian town. They came over to Italy together on an Egyptian smuggler ship. He was 12 at the time and crammed in with hundreds of others. He says his parents paid 35,000 Egyptian pounds (about $4,500) for the privilege, never guessing what it would really be like -- tossed around for nine days, surrounded by vomit, and scared, uncertain what would meet them on shore. I asked him what he would say to all the boys back at home, hoping to follow in his footsteps. He said he would warn them not to come but he also said he knew they wouldn't listen. "Why would they? I didn't," he says. "Everyone does what their mind tells them. They won't take what we say." I asked if, having suffered so much, he'd make the journey again? "What can I do? Yes. The burden back home is still the same." Italian authorities say he is one of more than 1,000 young Egyptians sheltered in 100 Italian care homes now dotting the Sicilian countryside. The cobbled streets and 17th Century architecture is a very long way from the Nile Delta villages many of the boys have come from. I asked one of his friends if he calls his parents and what he tells them about their lives here, and if he's told them how close to death he came. "I tell them nothing, just pleasantries and ask for their prayers. What difference would it make? They need me to make money." These boys tell us their parents went in to debt to raise the fare for their crossing. They saw it as an investment in what they hope will be a better future for the whole family. The children are expected to find work as soon as they can and start sending money home. Here at the care home, that's not possible so thousands of children are disappearing from the Italian social care networks. Italy's Ministry of Labor told us almost 4,000 Egyptian children disappeared from the care system. All the Italian authorities we spoke to who work with these children told us the pressure on the children would be unbearable even for an adult. They fear the consequences to their parents if the smugglers didn't get their money in full, or if the gamble doesn't pay off having sold what little of value they have. The missing children can't work legally. Social workers tell us that too often the children turn to drugs, even prostitution, to get by. Another boy we meet at the home asks me wistfully about Rome, which Italian authorities say is where so many of the disappeared head to. I told him Rome is dangerous for children on their own, especially on the streets. I told him the stories we'd heard from the Egyptian teenagers we'd met in Rome -- the exploitation and the homesickness. The Egyptian children in Rome tell stories of friends selling themselves on street corners -- but they sound suspiciously like they were speaking about themselves. I told him it's better to do it all the legal way and better for him to get an education. He listened politely until I'd finished then told me: "Better to be dead than useless."

        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Shiny rings, white gowns and luxury cars filled the mammoth national convention center, next to the Chinese capital's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, one recent weekend. Armed with balloons, teddy bears and goody bags filled with coupons, throngs of salespeople stood outside their booths, shoving free gifts into the hands of visitors in an attempt to turn them into clients. Spread across two floors, more than 200 vendors competed at Beijing's Olympic-sized wedding expo for the attention -- and, more importantly, the wallets -- of thousands of young couples. PHOTOS: Tibetan couple's unconventional wedding pictures go viral  Everything was on sale at a discount, but even a rough calculation on site pointed to the soaring cost of getting married in China. The total bill could easily exceed $20,000 -- an unimaginable sum just a few years ago -- counting a pair of rings, a bridal gown, a banquet, a photo shoot and a professional planner. In the United States, the average cost of a wedding -- excluding a honeymoon -- has a similar price tag of $25,200, according to the latest figure released by the Wedding Report, a market research firm. Although rapid economic growth has brought rising incomes, the average Chinese still makes only a fraction of their American counterpart. Government statistics show the annual disposable income for 2014 was only $3,283 per person in China. The ballooning cost of weddings has spurred a multi-billion-dollar industry, but also put a heavy burden on the more than 10 million couples marrying every year in the world's most populous nation, especially those who already feel financially strained trying to buy their first home and car. READ: How to get ahead on China's dating scene Faced with a deep-rooted cultural preference for marriage, however, young Chinese preparing to tie the knot admit that cutting back is not always an option. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event -- so I have to show my commitment to her and her parents through the wedding," explained Wang Di, 23, who was looking for good deals at the expo even though he and his girlfriend don't plan to walk down the aisle for another two years. "We may not care that much about the ceremony -- but the parents and other relatives do."  Frustrated with family pressure, some rebellious Chinese couples have chosen to enter so-called "naked marriages" with no houses, no cars, no weddings -- and sometimes no rings. While the public seems to appreciate the philosophy of true love trumping everything else, most respondents in repeated surveys still reject the notion of disavowing all traditional trappings of marriage. Increasingly, though, less radical -- but more creative and affordable -- ideas are gaining popularity in big cities. At a courtyard house in suburban Beijing one recent Saturday, the dress code was casual, but everyone appeared to be having some serious fun at the bride and groom's "do-it-yourself" wedding. On stage, the bride had already kicked off her high-heels. The venue was the couple's home -- rented for only $2,500 a year from a local farmer. The decoration that emphasized fresh flowers and entertainment -- featuring a DJ and a band -- were both courtesy of their artistic friends. Adorning the brick walls were various home-made movie-style posters starring the bride and groom, including one showing them laughing in bed with the phrase "mad love" in bold yellow lettering splashed across the red duvet covering their bodies. READ: Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market  "Almost every wedding now goes through the same drill and I don't want that," said bride Zhang Yueyue, a marketing manager at an arts magazine. "I think letting everyone have fun is the most important thing. Many Chinese weddings now are more about flaunting wealth and letting parents have 'face' through extravagance." Counting catering and tailor-made traditional Chinese dresses, Zhang and her artist husband spent less than $2,000 on their big day. With their modest incomes, the newlyweds agreed that saving from the wedding meant more money to start their married life together. Amid loud cheers and applause in the courtyard, some of the couple's guests already felt inspired. "My budget won't be high either," said Zhao Mengsha, a colleague and friend of the bride who is planning her own summer wedding. "I just want a big party with some entertainment -- and most importantly lots of alcohol." That definitely sounds like a winning formula for a special occasion.

        <corpo>(CNN)Many people dream of having a gin distillery in their living room, but for Ian Hart that dream is a reality. The Londoner owns the Sacred Spirits gin brand which he makes out of his home. Before embarking on his gin-distilling adventure, Hart worked in financial services, but lost his job in the wake of the global financial crisis. After attempting several other ventures, he decided to start experimenting with distilling various drinks, and finally settled on gin. Today, Hart's product is available in sixteen countries across the world, as well as high-end hotels and department stores in London. He shares his tips on how to start your own distillery with CNN.  Hart experimented with other types of liquor before settling on gin. He started with vintage Bordeaux wine and played with making gin after receiving a shipment of neutral spirits and botanicals. Hart pitched the product to his local drinking hole, which started including it in their drink offerings. From that point, the sales started to come in.  Hart stresses that when you are in the business of booze, it's crucial to obtain all the relevant permits and pay the appropriate duties. "Make sure your alcohol is top quality, properly tested and certified by an accredited laboratory," he says.  As the old adage goes, if you want to start a business you need to have enough capital to get it off the ground, and sustain periods when there will be no profit. Hart says that you should plan to have extra money to pay taxes, duties and all the other substantial costs of running a drinks business even during quiet times, when you may not sell that many bottles.  The entrepreneur says one of the biggest mistakes he made while building his business was printing too many logo stickers because price discounts offered in buying in bulk seemed attractive. "Then a year later when the label is redesigned, you are throwing thousands of pounds worth of overproduced old labels away," he says.  In Hart's view, paid advertising doesn't give a return to start with as you end up spending much more than you get back as profit, but that it's worth it if you want to raise customer awareness in the long haul. "Marketing through trade fairs, direct sales and cold calling is more productive in the short run -- and the short run is important if you are capital constrained," he says, adding that a catchy, memorable name for the product is also quite important.

        <titulo>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-15T00:41:30Z</data>
        <autor>Eliott C. McLaughlin and Dave Gilbert, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35&#186;C and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life </corpo>

        <titulo>Can Thai fishing industry tackle its slavery problem? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-17T13:46:14Z</data>
        <autor>Dean Irvine, Saima Mohsin, and Kocha Olarn, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has told CNN that slave labor in his country's fishing industry "is now severe" and that Thailand will act to tackle it. CNN investigates the scale of the problem in this special report. (CNN)The hours would be long and the work hard, but spending a year as a fisherman seemed like a good option to Samart Senasook. Previous jobs as a security guard in Bangkok had been sporadic, so when a man known as Vee promised the 40-year old decent wages on a fishing boat he decided to take the chance. Vee turned out to be a broker, a link in the chain of human trafficking that supplies the Thai fishing industry with thousands of migrant workers and turns many of them into virtual slaves. Instead of a year on board a Thai fishing vessel, Senasook said he spent six, and was made to work 20-hour days in life-threatening conditions. His unwanted odyssey only came to an end last month, thousands of miles from Thailand, on the eastern Indonesian island of Ambon. The boat he was on was impounded by Indonesian authorities for suspected illegal fishing, with Senasook and his crewmates held in custody.  Looking back on his ordeal, that he says lasted from January 2009 to March 2015, Senasook rarely saw land, as the boat he was on roamed further and further from Thai waters in search of increasingly scarce fish. Its catch was part of Thailand's multi-billion dollar seafood industry that feeds tens of millions in Europe and the United States. Senasook describes his life on board as one full of intimidation, sleep deprivation and regular beatings from the boat's captain. "(The captain) kicked and punched me," he said. "My nose and mouth were bleeding. I still have blood clotted in my teeth. My jaw hurts every time I chew." With no way to escape, he became suicidal. "I was thinking of my family, my mother. There were times, I was about to jump into the sea to kill myself. "My friend from the engine room held me back. Otherwise I would have been dead by now," he said. Senasook says the boat's captain kept his and the crew's ID at all times, essentially holding them captive. When Senasook did finally get his hands on his identity card on Ambon, he was horrified to see it was in a false name. He had gone from being captive on board a fishing boat to being stranded on a distant island. "There are many of my friends die in Indonesia. And their graves were with wrong names," said Senasook. "Like, if I died, at my grave it would not bear my name but it would be someone else." In desperation, he wrote an open letter to the Thai Prime Minister asking for help. That helped to release him from Indonesian custody, but, isolated and penniless, he could not make his way home to Thailand. He received a final payment of 1,750 baht ($53) from his ship's captain, but was then told he needed to pay 20,000 baht ($615) for the agent fee that brought him on the boat in 2009.  Eventually he received assistance from Thai-based Labor Rights Promotion Network (LPN) and was repatriated to Thailand last month. He was one of the more fortunate ones. The LPN discovered a similar situation on the nearby island of Benjina, where the group says hundreds of other fishermen from across Southeast Asia were trapped and living in desperate conditions. The rights group estimates there could be up to 3,000 trafficked victims working on boats in these seas. "(The fishermen on Ambon and Benjina) have forged or no documents so can't return home," said the LPN's Patima Tangpratyakoon. "The situation is severe." But the problem of modern day slaves fishing for seafood that ends up on dinner plates on the other side of the world goes much further than these tiny Indonesian islands. The extent of the situation is hard to gauge. Thai government figures state that there are 145,000 working in its fishing industry, with 80% of those migrant workers, mainly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. However, activist group Raks Thai Foundation suggests there are in excess of 200,000 trafficked, unregistered workers. The exact number of fishing vessels is also unknown -- official figures put them at around 57,000 -- because registration is lax. The real number could be double that.  The issue of slavery and rights abuses in the Thai fishing industry has become acute in recent years. As the global demand for seafood has increased, the Thai economy improved, so attracting workers to dangerous jobs on fishing boats has become more difficult. Last year the U.S. State Department downgraded Thailand to the lowest tier on its Trafficking in Persons Report 2014, which can result in the withdrawal of international aid. Last month the European Union called Thailand a "non-cooperating" country because of poor monitoring and control of its fishing vessels and the trade of fish and seafood from other countries into Thailand. Unless it cracks down on the situation, Thailand faces a financially damaging embargo on its fish exports to the EU from October. In response, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has declared combating human trafficking a national priority. In a statement in March, he called on all government agencies to "clean up their houses." Traffickers and government officials that have colluded with them "no longer have any room to exist in Thai society," he said. According to Thailand's Department of Fisheries, new control measures are being implemented. As well as inspections of fishing vessels, boats more than 30 tons in size that travel outside of Thai waters will have to be equipped with an electronic vessel monitoring system (VMS). Without it, the boats will not be given a fishing license. However, only around 6,000 boats in the Thai fishing fleet are of this size, according to the Marine Department. Another new government initiative that came into play in April requires each fishing vessel to list who is on board, who it is licensed to, the name of its owner, and where it will operate before it leaves port and once it returns. These "port-out, port-in" measures "will help enable us to reduce the risk of human trafficking, reduce the risk of force labor," said Warapon Prompol, deputy director-general, Department of Fisheries. Crew manifests were not previously required. "For the Marine Department we can check only a certain type of vessel, a certain size, too. But now the government is trying to reduce the size (of the vessel) that allows that we can check them," said Chula Sukmanop, director-general to the Marine Department. He added that enforcement is made more difficult because all too often ships will change crew once they leave port.  While laws against human trafficking exist in the country -- a new Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act was approved as recently as March -- it has often been this lack of enforcement that has allowed exploitation of fishermen to continue. "There have been laws that should penalize employers with penalties and not just the migrants themselves, but they've been rarely enforced in the past," said Max Tunon, senior program manager for the International Labour Organization, who specializes in migrant workers' rights in Southeast Asia. "This is the most attention there's been on the issue, coming from the highest level," he added. "There's a greater acknowledgment that corruption exists and that increasing regulation (of the industry) needs to be linked to the broader issues of migration." Exports by Thai seafood companies to the United States and Europe are worth around $2.5 billion annually, with Thai Union Frozen Products (TUF) one of the largest -- and owner of the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands. In a statement in March, Khun Thiraphong Chansiri, TUF's president and CEO, called human trafficking in its supply chain "utterly unacceptable," but said "we all have to admit that it is difficult to ensure the Thai seafood industry's supply chain is 100% clean." Progress to combat the problems of trafficked workers and slave labor has been made thanks to market and trade pressure, said Tunon. But it's still hard to see real change on the ground. "It's been a challenge for years and it will be hard to measure progress because there has not been much of a baseline from which to gather credible information on the problem," said Tunon. "The attention is now on the fishing industry, as it's particularly vulnerable, but this could help better protection for migrant workers in sections that don't have consumer or trade pressure, that aren't so visible because they don't feed into the global supply chain." </corpo>

        <corpo>Cairo (CNN)A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break. Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years. Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging. The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated." "President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt." It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, in 2013.

        <data>2015-06-16T07:21:17Z</data>
        <autor>Madison Park, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)Kim Jong Un watched two drills featuring what North Korean media called a new type of "anti-ship rockets," according to the country's newspaper Rodong Sinmun. The front page of the state newspaper featured pictures of a beaming Kim leaning back in a chair, surrounded by his smiling military cabal. Rodong Sinmun reported two drills -- one in daylight with anti-ship rockets and another one at night, testing both ground artillery and warships. The reports did not specify exactly where and exactly when the drills were held. The newspaper described the rockets as "highly intelligent" that detected and hit "enemy" warships in the drill. And it reported that Kim "appreciated their high concentrated firing" and apparently remarked that "shells seemed to have eyes." Earlier on Sunday, South Korean defense officials had reported the firing of three short-range anti-ship missiles from North Korea's eastern coast. South Korean officials had described the three missiles as KN-01 missiles. The KN-01 missiles are based on Soviet and Chinese technology with a range of 120 kilometers (74 miles), according to Globalsecurity.org. This isn't the first time North Korea has tested anti-ship rockets this year. Similar tests were conducted in February and again in May with proclamations made in North Korea's state media. On Monday, North Korea once again offered to hold talks with the South -- with conditions. But it seems unlikely that South Korea would accept the North's conditions, which includes ceasing all joint military exercises with the United States. Seoul and Washington have consistently dismissed those demands. CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>New York prison break: Search area expands - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>Jethro Mullen, Shimon Prokupecz and Randi Kaye, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)With few clues pointing toward where two murderers went after they escaped from a New York prison, investigators are changing tack. It's day 11 of the search, and now the area hundreds of law enforcement officers are combing is expanding, New York State Police said Tuesday evening. Teams will be redeployed to new areas near the prison in Dannemora, New York, police said, saying the shifting search zone was based on information uncovered so far in the hunt for the fugitives. More than 800 local, state and federal officers are popping open trunks, peering into cars and scouring heavily wooded areas. Canine units are also still searching for a scent that might lead police to Richard Matt and David Sweat, who escaped from a maximum-security facility known as "Little Siberia" in upstate New York on June 6. Motion detectors and cameras have been placed in the woods, and an airplane able to fly at high altitude and detect movements on the ground is aiding in the search, a New York state official said. But despite promising leads, the official said, the search has gone cold. Authorities are also offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the escaped inmates' arrests. It's not clear how much has been spent, but judging from the boots on the ground, it can't be cheap. Police have developed 1,200 leads, according to New York State Police. But so far it's not clear whether any of them will pan out. Authorities have said the killers could be anywhere -- in Vermont, Mexico or still be in the woods near the prison. Despite promising leads last week -- including an abandoned campfire, human tracks and a bloodhound picking up a possible scent -- hopes of finding Matt and Sweat anytime soon appear to be on the wane, the state official said.  Joyce Mitchell, a prison employee, sits in jail while Matt and Sweat, whose escape she is accused of assisting, remain on the run. While solid information about the killers' whereabouts seems to be lacking, more details are coming to light about Mitchell's relationships with them and the escape plot, which one official says could have taken a deadly turn. Mitchell's husband, Lyle, visited her in prison Tuesday morning. Authorities announced after the escape that the husband, too, was under investigation. In recent days, however, sources have told CNN that Joyce Mitchell had relationships with Matt and Sweat -- and the relationship with at least one of the men was sexual -- and Matt and Sweat had intended to kill Lyle Mitchell upon their escape. Lyle Mitchell was his wife's first visitor, and he spent an hour with her. The pair were separated by glass and spoke over a phone in a private, unmonitored conversation, Favro said. Lyle Mitchell was supportive, and his wife seemed comforted by his visit, the sheriff said. Joyce Mitchell's attorney, Stephen Johnston, said he did not know what the two talked about. "All I know is that he said that he is standing by her, so that's what he told me when I spoke to him," the attorney told reporters. Asked about his client's state of mind, he said, "She is distraught, very weepy and very upset." Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie has not commented much on the husband, other than to say he's under investigation, but he told CNN on Tuesday that Lyle Mitchell had hired attorney Peter Dumas.  Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor, is accused of sneaking hacksaw blades, chisels, drill bits, a punch and other contraband into the two convicts' hands. She has pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against her but has been talking to investigators. Matt and Sweat had a plan to kill Mitchell's husband, who worked in the same tailoring block as his wife, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation said. It's unclear why, when they intended to do it and how much Joyce Mitchell actually knew about that plan, but Johnston told reporters that he thought the allegation was likely bogus. "I don't know very much about it other than I believe it's a specious plan, a specious argument," he said. "The problem is I've been involved in this since yesterday morning and law enforcement has been interviewing her and interviewing a lot of other witnesses for many, many days." Investigators are looking into whether the two inmates threatened Mitchell to force her to help in the escape, the New York state official told CNN. Investigators believe Mitchell began getting cold feet about executing the plan but possibly had agreed to be the getaway driver because of threats to her and her husband, the official said. Favro says his gut instinct tells him Mitchell wasn't the convicts' main getaway plan, because she "would have been baggage to them." "She was the backup plan, not the front plan," he told CNN.  Mitchell was having a sexual relationship with Matt, the source with detailed knowledge of the investigation said. She'd also been investigated in the past for an inappropriate relationship with Sweat that led corrections officials to move him out of the tailor shop and keep them separated, said Wylie, the district attorney. Mitchell told authorities that the two inmates picked a destination for their getaway, but that they did not give her any specifics. "That was the information that she was told by Matt and Sweat -- that it was about seven hours away," Wylie said. It's not clear if Mitchell has shared everything she knows, the prosecutor said. "It's apparent that she's trying to be as truthful as possible, but in any of these investigations, we always find out that potentially somebody continues to hold things back for one reason or another, and that may be the case here," he said. At this point, investigators can't say for sure whether anybody else was involved, Wylie said. Mitchell has been in jail since last week and will remain there unless she posts a $220,000 bond or $110,000 in cash. If convicted, she could face up to eight years behind bars.

        <titulo>Einstein letters fetch more than $420,000 at auction - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>(CNN)What did Albert Einstein think about adultery, the atomic bomb and God? At an auction last week, bidders shelled out just over $420,000 to own a piece of the Nobel prize winner's letters tackling these topics and other questions he faced during his lifetime. Organizers said the highlight of Thursday's auction -- which included 27 letters from Einstein -- was a 1945 letter about the connection between his special relativity theory and the atomic bomb. The genius physicist sent it to his son Hans less than a month after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it sold for $62,500, according to the Profiles in History auction house in Calabasas, California. A 1939 communication from Einstein to President Franklin Roosevelt helped start the U.S. efforts to build an atomic bomb, but Einstein later said he regretted taking that step. In the letter to his son in 1945, Einstein wrote that his work and the bomb were "only very indirectly connected." "I already showed 39 years ago that pursuant to the special relativity theory, there is an equivalence between the mass and energy of a system or that both are only different manifestations of the same thing," he wrote. "I also noted that the energies released in radioactive decay are big enough to express themselves in an inaccuracy of the mass balance of radioactive reactions. That's all." The letters -- most written in German but some in English -- offer an inside look at Einstein's personal beliefs, like his thoughts about religion and the likelihood of the existence of God. In a 1945 letter to Guy H. Raner, Einstein described himself as an atheist. "From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with these outside of the human sphere -- childish analogies," he wrote, according to the auction organizers. Four years later, he wrote to Raner again. But this time, according to auction's organizers, his views seem to have shifted. He disparaged atheism and instead declared himself agnostic. "I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one," he wrote. "I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being." While many of the letters addressed his scientific work, religion and major political events of the time, Einstein also took time to share more personal thoughts with close friends and family. In another letter to his son Hans, he promised to send math problems to solve. And in a letter to a friend, he offered words of encouragement after learning of her husband's infidelity. In total, the letters generated $420,625, the auction house said. "The auction was extremely successful," said Marc Kruskol, a spokesman for Profiles in History. "The Einstein letters sold for more than we expected." </corpo>

        <titulo>Who is the 2,000-year-old 'sleeping beauty'? - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-15T09:52:00Z</data>
        <autor>Daisy Carrington, for CNN</autor>
        <corpo>(CNN)It was the Queen of Sheba that first drew Louise Schofield -- an archaeologist and former curator at the British Museum -- to the Gheralta plateau in northern Ethiopia. She'd heard tell of a 20-foot stone stele carved with an inscription and a symbol often linked to the biblical queen: a sun and crescent moon. "The story of the Queen of Sheba has a central place in the heart of all Ethiopians, so I became interested in the story myself," she recalls (Sheba is thought to be located in parts of Ethiopia). It was this initial visit that ultimately led her to discover the 2,000-year-old remains of a character she fondly refers to as "sleeping beauty." The grave was discovered at the stone stele, in an area that was once part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum, which today encompasses Ethiopia and Eritrea. Inside, Schofield's team found the skeleton of a woman posed in a resting position, with her chin laid gently on one hand. A Roman-era bronze mirror was placed before her face. The corpse was surrounded with glass vessels (to catch the tears of the dead), as well as a bronze cosmetics spoon and a lump of kohl eyeliner. "She must have been very wealthy, and probably well-loved to be placed in this position, and judging by all the items of finery around her," surmised Schofield. The dig also uncovered several other graves, all of which had several bodies buried beneath. In some, she found the remains of large warriors clad who each wore an iron bangle. "We think they were warriors from a battle," she says. The unusual find suggests trade between Rome and Aksum started at least 200 years earlier than previously believed. As the dig is less than a month old, there's still a lot of information yet to come in about this restful lady. A bone expert wasn't able to ascertain her age at the time of death because the pelvis -- which usually provides a close approximation -- had been consumed by termites. Schofield hopes that analysis of the teeth will provide some answers. "There was something very personal about the way she was lying," Schofield says. The remains were also found surrounded by clay containers that likely contained food or drink (these have also been sent off for analysis). "The food, drink and cosmetics were all presumably left for her to use in the afterlife. She was pre-Christian and that's how people buried their dead then," says Schofield. Shofield has a bit of the Midas touch when it comes to extraordinary finds. She also recently uncovered a Roman-era perfume flask in the same cemetery, although by chance. The archaeologist is also the director of London-based NGO The Tigray Trust, and the item was first brought to her attention by a local farmer she knew through the organization. "I had been showing around a member of the Peace Corps who had been working in a nearby town (around the site), and we'd been out in the blazing sun for 8 hours, when a farmer I knew said his friend found something old, and he'd been keeping it for me," she recalls. "I was apologizing to the Peace Corps guy. I told him, 'it could be an old coffee pot, but you never know, it could be the Queen of Sheba's perfume flask.'"

        <corpo>(CNN)It was the Queen of Sheba that first drew Louise Schofield -- an archaeologist and former curator at the British Museum -- to the Gheralta plateau in northern Ethiopia. She'd heard tell of a 20-foot stone stele carved with an inscription and a symbol often linked to the biblical queen: a sun and crescent moon. "The story of the Queen of Sheba has a central place in the heart of all Ethiopians, so I became interested in the story myself," she recalls (Sheba is thought to be located in parts of Ethiopia). It was this initial visit that ultimately led her to discover the 2,000-year-old remains of a character she fondly refers to as "sleeping beauty." The grave was discovered at the stone stele, in an area that was once part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum, which today encompasses Ethiopia and Eritrea. Inside, Schofield's team found the skeleton of a woman posed in a resting position, with her chin laid gently on one hand. A Roman-era bronze mirror was placed before her face. The corpse was surrounded with glass vessels (to catch the tears of the dead), as well as a bronze cosmetics spoon and a lump of kohl eyeliner. "She must have been very wealthy, and probably well-loved to be placed in this position, and judging by all the items of finery around her," surmised Schofield. The dig also uncovered several other graves, all of which had several bodies buried beneath. In some, she found the remains of large warriors clad who each wore an iron bangle. "We think they were warriors from a battle," she says. The unusual find suggests trade between Rome and Aksum started at least 200 years earlier than previously believed. As the dig is less than a month old, there's still a lot of information yet to come in about this restful lady. A bone expert wasn't able to ascertain her age at the time of death because the pelvis -- which usually provides a close approximation -- had been consumed by termites. Schofield hopes that analysis of the teeth will provide some answers. "There was something very personal about the way she was lying," Schofield says. The remains were also found surrounded by clay containers that likely contained food or drink (these have also been sent off for analysis). "The food, drink and cosmetics were all presumably left for her to use in the afterlife. She was pre-Christian and that's how people buried their dead then," says Schofield. Shofield has a bit of the Midas touch when it comes to extraordinary finds. She also recently uncovered a Roman-era perfume flask in the same cemetery, although by chance. The archaeologist is also the director of London-based NGO The Tigray Trust, and the item was first brought to her attention by a local farmer she knew through the organization. "I had been showing around a member of the Peace Corps who had been working in a nearby town (around the site), and we'd been out in the blazing sun for 8 hours, when a farmer I knew said his friend found something old, and he'd been keeping it for me," she recalls. "I was apologizing to the Peace Corps guy. I told him, 'it could be an old coffee pot, but you never know, it could be the Queen of Sheba's perfume flask.'"

        <titulo>Fame poses new risk for China's 'magic rabbit' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas. </corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi who has seen it all: ISIS in Mosul to stay - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-10T12:25:21Z</data>
        <autor>Ben Wedeman, CNN International Correspondent</autor>
        <corpo>Baghdad (CNN)We had just finished up our shoot in Al-Makasib Girls' Elementary School in Baghdad's Saadoun neighbourhood and were loading the gear into the car when a man sitting in a wheelchair across the courtyard beckoned to me. "Come, talk to me, too," he said. He introduced himself as Louay Hikmat Shawkat, Iraqi Army veteran of the war with Iran and then the 1991 Kuwait war, refugee from Mosul and a self-described translator of English, French, "Canadian" and "Yugoslavian." Given that the latter two aren't languages, and his English was a tad scratchy, I was intrigued. We were visiting the school to talk to its current "residents" -- 48 Christian families who had fled Mosul when ISIS took over a year ago. Mosul, in northern Iraq and one of the nation's largest cities, is about 405 kilometers (about 250 miles) from the capital of Baghdad. But for these internal refugees, it might as well be a world away. I asked Louay, who is 60, when he thought he might be able to return home.  "Take it out of your mind that ISIS is going to leave Mosul," he insisted, gesturing with his hand as if he were pulling a thread out of his head. The chances he and his wife will someday return to their home in the Mosul suburb of Hamdaniya, he said, are "one in a hundred. One in a million!" Louay said he suffers from diabetes, but he insists on lighting up another cigarette in his nicotine-stained fingers "because I get upset whenever I speak about "Da'ish", the Arabic acronym for ISIS. ISIS, he said, "is an illness. It's impossible to cure. Cancer can be cured, tuberculosis can be cured. Almost every illness can be cured, but not this one." His diabetes causes him to suffer from dizziness whenever he stands up. "If I were well," he vows, "I would go fight them myself." Like everyone else I spoke with at the school, he is desperate to leave Iraq, but his attempts to apply for asylum have come to naught. His last hope, he told me with a mischievous grin, is an old Canadian girlfriend in Montreal.  In the school's makeshift kitchen, I met Linda Jannan, who was busy with the washing up. She fled Mosul with her husband and three children in August, first going to Dohuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they spent six months in a tent in a refugee camp. A thin women in her 30s with the dark circles under her eyes, she also was desperate to leave Iraq. "We are finished," she told me. "Our future, our children, our men have been destroyed. We're too afraid to go out and find work. If only someone outside Iraq will help us find a solution, let us emigrate. We have no hope left." She and her husband had applied to asylum in the United States and Germany, but they were rejected because they have no close relatives in either country. Obama: No 'complete strategy' yet on training Iraqis Over the past few months, these refugees have been visited by a variety of reporters. And it's clear their patience is wearing thin. "What's the point of all this talk?" one man asked me, after declining my request for an on-camera interview. "We talk, we talk, and nothing happens," he snapped. Firyal Abdel Kareem, who was sharing the kitchen with Linda Jannan, is at her wits' end. She spent the winter months in a windy tent in Zakho, near the Turkish border, and is now suffering from Baghdad's sweltering summer heat. "Find a solution for us," she told me, "it's enough. We are tired." "Either they take us out of here, or send us home. Do we have to stay in this school, or in a tent?"  I've been covering Iraq since 1994. I covered the impact of the draconian international sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. I covered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the messy, bloody aftermath. And now I'm back covering the war against ISIS. I'm lucky. I come and go as I please. For the people in this school, there is no such luxury. Thair Al-Naim, his wife and their three young sons left behind a relatively comfortable life in Mosul last summer. He's now penniless and out of work, all his construction equipment seized and sold by ISIS. Speaking to him in the classroom they now call "home," I sense a deep weariness with a life that, for too long, has been fraught with violence and fear. "Since the fall of Saddam," he sighs, "all we've had is war after war, and now we have Da'ish." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Chinese astronaut: We want more cooperation - CNN.com</titulo>

        <autor>David McKenzie, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>"Inside Space City," a world exclusive CNN interview with three of China's top astronauts, premieres on Saturday May 30 at 11:30 am HKT/ 3:30 am GMT Beijing (CNN)China wants greater cooperation with other nations in space, particularly the United States, the country's most experienced astronaut has told CNN in an exclusive interview. Fifteen nations including the United States, Russia and Japan cooperate on International Space Station missions, but China's involvement has always been a non-starter because of longstanding resistance from U.S. legislators. INTERACTIVE: IS CHINA WINNING THE SPACE RACE? "As an astronaut, I have a strong desire to fly with astronauts from other countries. I also look forward to going to the International Space Station," Commander Nie Haisheng told CNN. "...Space is a family affair, many countries are developing their space programs and China, as a big country, should make our own contributions in this field." The comments came during a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with the three-person crew of the Shenzhou-10 mission inside Space City, the center of China's space program, near Beijing last month. In 2011, Congress passed an act to bar NASA from having any bilateral contact with individuals of the Chinese space program because of national security fears. "Every time it gets mentioned at all anywhere near Congress, it gets shut down immediately," space analyst Miles O'Brien told CNN. "There is tremendous skepticism there about China. It is viewed as a foe, it is viewed as a government that seeks to take our intellectual property -- our national secrets and treasure." In a white paper released Tuesday, China said that outer space had become an area of "strategic competition." "The Chinese government has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space, it opposes space weaponization and an arms race in outer space. This position will not be changed," Wang Jin, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said. MORE: NASA astronaut: We risk losing out to China  A recent report for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said China's improving space capabilities had "negative sum consequences for U.S. military security." But Nie discounted those fears. "The United States and Russia started their space programs early. They are the pioneers," he said. He says foreign astronauts are welcome to visit China's own space station once it is launched. The Chinese expect to finish their space station by 2022 -- around the time International Space Station runs out of funding, potentially leaving China as the only country with a permanent presence in space. China launched its manned space program in 1992. It initially borrowed and bought a great deal of Russian technology, primarily by replicating their Soyuz space craft -- which they dubbed the Shenzhou. But it has been steadily checking off the boxes in manned space flight. In 2003, it put its first man in space. In 2008, it completed its first space walk. And in 2013 Nie and his crew completed the country's longest space mission to date and twice docked with the Tiangong-1 space lab. MORE: Meet the crew of the Shenzhou-10  With support from the highest echelons of the ruling Chinese Communist Party and exceptionally deep pockets, most analysts believe China's space program could become a world leader. "I think in the end -- tortoise versus hare style, they will probably win," said O'Brien. In October last year, China launched its most ambitious unmanned space mission to date: to orbit the moon and then return to Earth. Nicknamed "Xiaofei," or "Little Flyer" on Chinese social networks, the unmanned orbiter traversed 840,000 kilometers on its eight-day mission that saw it round the far side of the moon and take some incredible pictures of Earth and the moon together, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It then successfully re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and parachuted down to the surface in Inner Mongolia. Wu Yanhua, vice director of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, said at the time the successful test mission has gathered a lot of experimental data and laid "a solid foundation for future missions." While China hasn't committed to it, many analysts think it wants to put a man on the moon. However, when asked, Commander Nie won't be drawn on whether this is the ultimate goal of the country's space program. "For the next step, the focus is Tiangong-2 and then we will do more preparatory work for the space station." </corpo>

        <titulo>YSL ad with 'unhealthily' thin model banned in UK - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-06-03T14:14:04Z</data>
        <autor>Mairi Mackay, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>London (CNN)The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an ad for fashion brand Yves Saint Laurent featuring a model who it said was "unhealthily underweight." The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the black-and-white image of a model in a short, black dress and platform high heels was "irresponsible." The ad appeared in Elle UK magazine. The model's pose and the lighting effect drew attention to her rib cage, which was "visible and appeared prominent," the ruling found. The ad also focused on her legs, adding that "her thighs and knees appeared a similar width, and ... looked very thin," especially the "contrast between the narrowness of her legs and her platform shoes," according to the ruling. The ad is the latest in a long line of controversies surrounding the fashion industry's use of thin models, among them the death from anorexia of French model Isabelle Caro following a shocking ad campaign and bans on ultra-skinny models in Israel and France. The UK agency looked into the ad following a complaint from an Elle UK reader. In response to the ruling, Yves Saint Laurent SAS indicated it didn't agree with the view that the model was unhealthily thin "but did not provide a detailed response," the agency said. Both Elle UK magazine and Yves Saint Laurent declined to comment on the ban when CNN reached out to them. A representative from Beat, a UK charity that supports those affected by eating disorders said: "The constant portrayal of a very slender look as the only aspirational ideal for young people needs to be challenged if a generation (is) to grow up with a robust sense of their self-worth." "The ASA ruling is not about whether this person in the picture is healthy, but whether the images of her are being used in a way that can have an irresponsible effect on others, and we are really pleased to see that they are taking action to uphold their responsibility for the social impact of adverts," the rep added. The Advertising Standards Authority said that the ad must not appear again in its current form and called on advertisers to ensure images in their ads were created responsibly. </corpo>

        <corpo>Lampedusa, Italy (CNN)The Italian Navy approached the rickety wooden ship with caution, and a wide berth. Go in too quickly, and the people onboard become so excited about their impending rescue that they capsize by all moving to one side. This is how so many of the drowning disasters have happened. As European leaders decide on measures to tackle the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the race to save lives on the high seas goes on, as our CNN team witnessed firsthand. We started our day on a helicopter bound for the frigate Virginio Fasan, one of the Italian Navy's most modern warships, currently in international waters facing the Libyan coast. Along with four other Italian naval vessels they patrol an area of sea about the size of the United Kingdom; some 80,000 square miles. It's a huge effort for the 1,000 men and women continuously at sea, because each rescue takes several hours. Barely 30 minutes into our chopper flight journey the pilot tells us they have spotted a boat, possibly full of migrants. And onboard screens beaming imagery of a wooden vessel packed to the gills confirms their suspicions. The blue boat is on course for Lampedusa, they've completed almost half the journey from Libya 85 miles from where we are... now in international waters the smugglers use their cell phones to call the Italian coast guard for help! That's their MO. The warship Sfinge (Sphinx) is closest, and is promptly dispatched to rescue those onboard. Crew on smaller boats hand out the distinctive orange life vests as soon as they arrive. To get closer and at sea level&#8212;we fly back to the Fasan and get into the ship's speed boat, and watch as navy teams move people to the warship in small groups. All personnel involved in the operation are dressed head to toe in white biohazard suits, face masks and gloves, in case of infectious disease. We're told that in all the crossings not a single case of Ebola has been brought over. The boat has been checked for hostile intent, and once the navy is satisfied they are all migrants, they begin the slow process of off-loading these people and transferring them by their two small boats to the warship. One by one they bring each person up the stairs&#8212;give them a medical, hand out bottles of water, and sit them in rows on the top deck, under the broiling sun. Men are separated from the women and children. One person died, suffocated during the overcrowded boat ride from Libya. Three people had to be medevaced off&#8212;but in all this mission saved 289 lives. They are among 900 who were saved on Wednesday in three different wooden boats, because it was sunny and calm. Most of the migrants saved on this day are from Ethiopia, Sudan, and Eritrea in East Africa, escaping a dictatorial regime and military service that they say amounts to slavery. Almost nobody on board speaks English, but one man tells us his story, saying he left his wife and children over a year ago, and hopes his arrival in Europe will mean he can afford a better life for them back home. And even though he knows a lot of people have died trying to make this dangerous crossing, he tells he was not afraid. "We have one chance, to live or to die," he says. We also talk to 25-year-old Juri, who tells us that God answered their prayers in the form of the Italian Navy. "God is good," she says with a big smile on her face, "they save our lives." UPDATE: On Friday, UNHCR reported that 180 of those rescued had been transferred to four facilities in eastern Sicily. The rest, they say, are still at the port and will be transferred soon. The one fatality was a 17-year-old Eritrean man, who reportedly died of asphyxiation in the hull of the boat. CNN's Mick Krever contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Photographer documents possessions of Chinese families - CNN.com</titulo>
        <data>2015-05-18T11:26:36Z</data>
        <autor>Shen Lu, CNN</autor>
        <corpo>Beijing (CNN)For more than a decade, Chinese photographer Ma Hongjie has asked dozens of families across the country to empty their homes and pose in front of everything they own. His goal is to tell the stories of those who have been bypassed by China's economic boom -- the people living on the bottom rung of society that haven't enjoyed the fruits of the country's transformation. "The possessions are not even wealth. It's just their lives -- showing how the grassroots try to make a living," said Ma, a photo editor at Chinese National Geography magazine. While the mesmerizing images show a variety of landscapes, lifestyles and cultures, what's most striking is their similarity -- the neatly lined up possessions are mostly daily essentials and tools of trade. Their owners appear proud yet humble. Almost all of Ma's subjects are rural families. He has asked richer families living in cities to participate, but they weren't willing to take part in the project, he said. They possess a lot more, and were afraid of the repercussions of showcasing their wealth, Ma explained. "Yet grassroots were fully at ease showing me whatever they have," he said. "They'd first feel wary about my request, but when I showed the samples they thought it was interesting." Although China now is the second largest economy after the United States, it is also home to the second largest number of poor people in the world, according to the World Bank. Almost 100 million people lived below the national poverty line of $1 a day in 2012.  In his book, which is due to be published later in May, Ma gives the back stories of the families he's photographed. The deepest impression the people he profiled has left upon him is their attitude. Powerless, they never demand anything, Ma said. "Are they satisfied? No. But they have no choice but to accept whatever happens to them," he added. "But they try to live with however little they possess." Although humbling, it also frustrated him. "They suffer from silence." Ma recently revisited the first family he profiled. They lived in a rural town in a mountainous area of Hunan province in southeastern China, back in 2003. To his dismay, nothing had changed in the 10 years since his first visit; their shabby house had become even shabbier, he said. Their sons wanted to get married, but the family couldn't afford to build new homes for them. They had hoped tourism would develop in this old town so that the family would be subsidized for moving out&#8212;then the sons would be able to marry, he said.  Similar stories unfolded everywhere Ma traveled. The Sun family live on boats on the Yellow River that winds through China's heartland. Sun Guiyou, who has been traversing the rivers and lakes for his entire life, says his biggest dream is to one day have a permanent house built on the land. Although the family say they are better off since he first photographed them in 2006, nothing much has changed and they haven't been able to build a home on solid ground. "The way they make a living doesn't change, they are still fishing," he said. "The grandchildren didn't get a good education, or even dropped out of school. You can see them repeating their grandparent's life in the future."  Ma said he was stunned by the diversity of cultures and lifestyles he came across and that it was harrowing to witness these traditions erode. Only a few of the local artisans and performers he met said their offspring were willing to carry on their crafts. Instead, they go to the cities and become migrant workers. When he visited a village in Hainan province in 2010, people lived in small huts. On his return years later, the huts had been replaced by brick and cement dwellings built by the government. In response, the villagers had built new huts next to the government subsidized housing instead, because they were not built in a way that suited their lifestyle. Ventilating smoke from how they cooked meals became difficult in those houses. "The local government thought living in huts was uncivilized, but they were unique," Ma said. "Why should everything be uniform?" The families he documented also shared a hatred of red tape - they bemoaned interference from the local government. So when the government decided to scrap an ancient tradition of taxing farmers for agricultural produce in 2006, farmers and peasants were thrilled by the news. "They simply want to be left alone -- 'Don't make our life so troublesome, let us farm and let us live,' they told me." Ma said. </corpo>

        <corpo>Northern Namibia (CNN)In January 2014, Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 for a permit to hunt and kill a black rhino in Namibia. He won the permit and became a target himself. The hunt is now complete. A rhino is dead. This is how it happened.  Windhoek, Namibia -- Knowlton arrived quietly in Namibia to hunt the famed black rhino. Nearly 18 months ago, the Texas hunter bid $350,000 to kill a black rhinoceros in the southern African country of Namibia. The permit was issued by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism and auctioned by the Dallas Safari Club. Since then, Knowlton has faced scathing criticism and death threats as the world reacted to the controversial hunt of one of the world's most endangered species. Knowlton has spent the last year and a half preparing and planning the hunt that is being highly scrutinized by animal welfare groups around the world. He agreed to let our CNN crew document the hunt. "At this point, the whole world knows about this hunt and I think it's extremely important that people know it's going down the right way, in the most scientific way that it can possibly happen," Knowlton said after arriving in Africa. Knowlton, 36, from Dallas, wants the world to see that the hunt of such a majestic beast on the African continent is not the work of a bloodthirsty American hunter but a vital component of Namibia's effort to save the animal from extinction. Knowlton's $350,000 will go to fund government anti-poaching efforts across the country. And the killing of an older rhino bull, which no longer contributes to the gene pool but which could harm or kill younger males, is part of the science of conservation, he argues. That's why he says he's doing more to save the black rhino than his critics, and why he wanted us along on this historic hunt. Opponents like the International Fund for Animal Welfare have not been swayed, saying hunting as conservation is a bankrupt notion. "We'll simply never agree with that," fund director Azzedine Downes said. "There's a lot of other things that we can and must do in order to protect these animals." The journey of this hunt will examine the emotional debate raging around the issue of how best to protect endangered species on a continent that is home to some of the most legendary animals on the planet. "I think people have a problem just with the fact that I like to hunt," Knowlton said. "I want to see the black rhino as abundant as it can be. I believe in the survival of the species."  Northern Namibia -- The hunt sets off with a sunrise flight to the region of Namibia where Knowlton will track a black rhino. There's a great deal of concern about news coverage of the hunt in Namibia. We've been told that when our reports are broadcast around the world that Namibian government officials fear poaching syndicates will use the information to identify the location of other black rhinos. For that reason, we have agreed not to report the specific locations of the hunt. According to animal conservationists, there are approximately 5,000 black rhinos in the wild worldwide today, 2,000 of them in Namibia. Hentie van Heerden is a professional hunter hired by the Namibian government to guide Knowlton on the highly scrutinized hunt of the black rhino. Van Heerden, 40, has an international clientele, mostly from Europe, who come to hunt wild game and the exotic animals of Africa. He was born in Namibia and grew up hunting. The thorn-infested terrain in the north of the country does not faze him. He wears sandals even when he hunts the wildest of animals. The bearded van Heerden has the dry sense of humor of a skilled hunter teaching a journalist what to do if we are to stare down a charging rhino. "The aim is to get out of its way without him flattening you," he said. "It's very rare that they come back for seconds and if that is the case, you have to get some more out of its way." Van Heerden says there are a few critics of the black rhino hunt in Namibia, but most people here embrace a culture of hunting. "There will always be activists and that's how they make their money," he said. "They have no clout here in Namibia, because people understand hunting." The hunt is sanctioned and monitored by Namibia's Ministry of Environment and Tourism. It has identified 18 black rhinos across the country that meet the criteria for being hunted and eliminated. The rhino must be an older rhino that is no longer reproducing and is considered a threat to younger, healthier rhinos. Rhinos are intensely territorial and will often kill each other in gruesome fights. Knowlton is targeting one of four black rhinos at the top of the government list, the ones considered "high priority threats to the herd." But identifying these rhinos in the dense brush and in the heat of a dangerous hunt makes Knowlton uneasy, though he will have the help of local trackers and guides. "If it charges at us and we are already sure it's the right one, we are going to kill it," Knowlton said. "If we aren't sure if it's the right one, we are going to try and get out of the way. If we don't feel like we can get out of the way, we got to kill it." That would be the worst-case scenario for Knowlton. For him, the rhino hunt must be carried out flawlessly.  Northern Namibia -- Just after sunrise, Knowlton arrives at a watering hole hidden deep in the Namibian brush to start the hunt. Two government trackers have spotted signs of a rhino heading away from the water. The footprint appears fresh. The weathered wrinkles of the rhino's hide are still visible in the print. The intricate details in the sand suggest the tracks are just a few hours old. The government tracker says, based on the footprints, he can tell this animal is probably one of the black rhinos Knowlton has been permitted to hunt, and that the animal is probably no more than 5 miles away. This is where the hunt begins. The trackers move quickly through the thorny bush and tall grasses. They rarely speak. Quick hand signals are all they need to show the path to follow. Silence is vital when you're tracking a black rhino. The hunting party winds its way through the brush. The rhino's footprints suggests the nearly 3,000 pound (1,360 kilogram) beast is meandering, which tells the hunters it does not feel threatened. As the heat of the day intensifies, rhinos will usually find shady areas to take quick naps. The ranger from the ministry who is observing and leading the trackers says the hunting party is gaining ground on the rhino. But the brush is so dense. Knowlton worries that we could stumble across the rhino at any moment and end up face to face. "I think people think of it as this docile thing," Knowlton said of his prey. "But you are dealing with an extremely athletic animal that can do whatever it wants to you very quickly." The only sounds are the brushes and scrapes of the hunting party cutting through the thorn-infested bushes of this terrain. It seems like every bush has wicked thorns that rip across our skin and clothing. Rhinos have an intense sense of smell and hearing that alerts them to danger from hundreds of yards away. The winds are swirling in the early afternoon hours and the tracker says the rhino can probably sense our presence and is moving away quickly. Knowlton is more concerned with something else. He's been told there are three rhinos known to inhabit the area he's in, but the Namibian government has only authorized the hunting of two of them. Visibility in the brush around us is down to about 15 feet (4.6 meters.) Knowlton is worried that if the rhino charges through the thick brush that he would only have a split second to decide whether to take the shot. It's becoming too risky. We've spent five hours trekking nearly 6 miles through the brush when Knowlton and his hunting partner decide to call it a day. Killing the wrong rhino, Knowlton said, would be a catastrophic mistake. Last year, one of Knowlton's critics suggested the trophy hunting of a black rhino was like shooting a couch in a living room. This criticism annoys Knowlton endlessly. He's quick to bring it up with a heavy dose of sarcasm. "So this is just like hunting a couch? Give me a break," he said. "This isn't easy. It's brutal."  On the road to southern Namibia -- Knowlton decides the hunt in the north is too treacherous. The brush is dense and visibility low. That's a dangerous combination for the hunting party and Knowlton knows that killing the wrong rhino will make him an even bigger target of international outrage. He and his hunting guide decide to drive to southern Namibia to target another dangerous black rhino that lives in a region with better visibility. But on the way we hear that rhino has died, probably of natural causes.  Northern Namibia -- Knowlton returns to the region that makes him the most nervous. And on this morning, the trails are not strong. The trackers have trouble finding prints leading away from the watering holes where the rhinos drink vast amounts of water. It's clear the rhino hunt will not end today.  Northern Namibia -- The morning starts with a startling discovery. Knowlton's professional hunting guide has discovered a camera image showing a rhino at a remote watering hole just before sunrise. The image is stunning. The rhino is more massive than I expected. Its horn is long with a lethal pointed tip. Knowlton spots a large gash in the rhino's ear. It's a crucial identifying mark that tells him instantly this rhino is on the approved government list to be hunted. The hunting party quickly picks up the tracks and disappears into the vicious African bush. The rhino footprints are fresh and light on the sand, telling the trackers the animal is slowly walking, eating grass and taking naps in the shade to avoid the rising sun. Today feels different. There's a sense that just beyond our view we are close to the rhino. The hunting party stops to drink water in the shade of a tree for 20 minutes. When the tracking resumes, Knowlton discovers the spot where the rhino had been resting not moments earlier. You can see the imprint of its wrinkled hide still fresh on the sandy ground. The rhino is close. Knowlton's hands firmly grip his high-powered 500 Nitro Express rifle. Moments later, I see a massive flash of gray leap up over the bushes some 50 feet in front of us. It disappears and you can't tell which direction the rhino is running. It's jarring to see this close how quickly these massive creatures can move. I remember the advice van Heerden, the professional hunting guide, gave me the day before. "You can't outrun the rhino," he said. "If it means to dive into a thorn bush to the left or to the right, we need to get out of its way in a big hurry." Now we can't see the rhino, but we know it's close. Van Heerden tells Knowlton, "He's angry. The next time he will charge." Twenty minutes later as the hunting party moves through the brush, I hear a sound I've not heard before during our trek. The rhino is moving around but it's invisible. It's impossible to grasp how such a beast can move like a ghost in the brush. The hunting party moves single file through a tree line. As the last member of the group emerges, he looks to his left and no more than 40 feet away the rhino is there, staring straight at us. "There it is!" says the last member in the group. It's a breathtaking sight. But this isn't the time to stand and stare. I cut to one side and the rhino starts charging in my direction. "Ed! Get down!" shouts van Heerden. I rush behind Knowlton and his hunting guide. "As soon as you dropped below my gun, I could see the whole animal right behind you," Knowlton would tell me later. I turn around and for a quick flash only see the top half of the rhino in front of us. Then four shots explode through the air. The rhino has been hit at least three times. The hunting party then makes the final push to find the rhino. I've lost track of time. This last push might have taken 30 minutes, it might have taken an hour. It was an incredibly emotional experience. A tracker climbs into a tree and spots the rhino in an open field about 100 yards away. Knowlton gets into position and fires the final shots. The black rhino is dead. Knowlton walks up from behind the rhino and when he's certain it's over, he kneels next to it. "Any time you take an animal's life it's an emotional thing," Knowlton said. The Namibian government official assures Knowlton it is the rhino on the approved hunting list. The trackers smile with relief and shake hands. I ask Knowlton if he still feels that killing this black rhino was the right thing to do and that it will benefit the future of this endangered species. "I felt like from day one it was something benefiting the black rhino," Knowlton reflected just moments after the hunt ended. "Being on this hunt, with the amount of criticism it brought and the amount of praise it brought from both sides, I don't think it could have brought more awareness to the black rhino."

        <titulo>Traitors no more? North Korean defectors 'forgiven' - CNN.com</titulo>

        <corpo>Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN)Kkot-jebi -- literally "flower swallows" -- sounds poetic, but the reality is much harsher. The North Korean term refers to homeless children, fending for themselves without the support of family or state. The word traces it roots back to the aftermath of the Korean War, an imaginative pronunciation of the Russian word "kochevyi," meaning "wandering," and referring to those displaced by the 1950-53 conflict. During the 1990s, North Korea was hit by several years of famine as disastrous harvests laid waste to the land, killing hundreds of thousands, according to conservative estimates. The country's social safety net was reduced to tatters. Families fell apart. And flower swallows re-emerged in large numbers. Although conditions today are much better, North Korea remains desperately poor. Food is in short supply for a large portion of the population -- and kkot-jebi are still very much in existence.  North Korea is one of the most secretive societies in the world. When a CNN team recently visited, our entire schedule was arranged by our official government hosts. Our "minders" accompanied us on every shoot. We had put in certain requests, but we never knew more than a few hours in advance what the next item on our itinerary would be. When we were told to go to a meeting room at our hotel one afternoon, we had no idea who was going to be behind the doors, just something to do with the reality of defectors. When we walked through the doors and saw eight young people sitting on one side of a huge round conference table, we immediately knew who we were to meet.  In early summer 2013, the world's media cried foul over the repatriation of a group of nine North Korea children, then aged between 14 and 19, from Laos. They had been picked up by border security as they were being smuggled from China into Laos by South Korean missionaries, in the hope of getting them resettled in South Korea. READ: Agonizingly close to freedom Pyongyang is not shy about its hatred of defectors. It refers to them in official media as "human scum" and accuses them of criminal acts, lying about their own country for fame and money and abandoning their own families. The decision to return the children was widely condemned. Dire predictions were made about their fate: The children were being sent back to prison; they would face a lifetime of retribution and could even be executed. But here in this room, nearly two years after their return, these former kkot-jebi appear transformed. Four young men dressed in the blue blazers of university students and two boys and two girls in secondary school uniforms, all sat waiting to answer our questions. The ninth member of the group was in a university further away from Pyongyang and could not be brought in at short notice.  They were all children between the ages of 12 and 17 when they crossed into China, separately or in small groups. They only met after they arrived at the missionaries' house. We asked why they left -- it was an uncomfortable opening question. "We were young," said 17-year-old Ri Gwang Hyok. "We just went to China for fun." Pressed for more detail, Mun Chol, 21, admitted: "Frankly, we had some family difficulties. We had been through a period in our history we call 'the arduous march (the years of famine).' We were not living well. I was young and naive. We were living by the Amnok river, which is at the border. I meant to return home. I was curious." We then asked how many of them had experienced hunger before they left. Four of the eight raised their hands. "It was winter. We had preserved food during autumn. But it wasn't enough. Our family was too large," explained Pak Kwang Hyok, 19. Once in China, the children were brought to a house in the border town of Dandong, looked after by a South Korean missionary CNN has called M.J. in previous reports, along with his wife. There, according to M.J., the starving children were transformed. According to the youngsters now, the picture was not so rosy. They said they were kept in the house for a year and a half. "The missionary lectured us about freedom," recalled Mun Chol. "But we weren't given any freedom. He forced us to study God and memorize religious books. "Of course, the food was good," he added, "but that was our only pleasure. When you have food things seem OK, but a kid needs more than that." Following our encounter with the students, CNN contacted M.J., who asked about their well-being. He says he misses them. While hesitant to say much out of fear for their safety, he insists the students needed his help after fleeing North Korea.  China is a historical ally of North Korea, and North Koreans found illegally in the country face deportation if caught. After a year and a half, the missionary decided to move the children to a third country. He chose Laos, on China's southwestern border, from where he hoped he could get them to South Korea. After a harrowing night trek for four hours through the hilly border region, the party were picked up by Laotian police and detained. When they were told they would be sent back to North Korea they were terrified. "The missionary said we would be killed if we went back," said Mun Chol. "He told us our families had been killed because we had left our homes."  But instead of being punished, they tell us they received special treatment, extra tuition to make up for three years of missed schooling, and are now studying in the best educational establishments in the capital. "I was scared," admitted Pak Gwang Hyok. "I had left my home with a guilty conscience and spent time abroad. We had betrayed our country. I thought we would be punished. But now we are studying in the best universities in Pyongyang. Our fears were pretty foolish." Soon after their return, the children appeared on North Korean television to denounce their enticement to defect by South Koreans. Now , more than a year later, they are again on display. They have become poster children for the "benevolence and forgiveness" of the North Korean authorities. There is a huge difference between their lives when they left for China and now. "I feel like a pauper who has become a prince," said Ri Gwang Hyok. But their families have not joined them in Pyongyang, the showcase capital. They remain in the poor border areas and their lives have not changed. When he thinks about what might have happened if he had made it to South Korea, Mun Chol said, "If I had made it, I could have become a traitor -- a bad guy who deserts his family. "I could have gone down in history as one of the 'scum of the earth.'" READ: North Korean: I felt like a slave in Kuwait </corpo>
